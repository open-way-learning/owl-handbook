\# Positions & Perspectives

Welcome to the Positions & Perspectives section of the Open Way Learning (OWL) Handbook. This space collects our evolving point-of-view papers on key ideas that shape how we work with schools, partners, and networks.

Where the \*\*About OWL\*\* section describes our mission, culture, and overall approach, these entries zoom in on specific themes—like open-source networks, experiential learning, or competency-based education—and explain how we think about them and why. Each is a living document, meant to be revisited and refined as we learn. :contentReference\[oaicite:0\]{index=0}  

\#\# 📌 What You'll Find

Current and anticipated entries in this section include:

\- \*\*\[Open Source Networking & Collaboration\](open-source-networking-collaboration.md)\*\*    
  Explores “the open” in Open Way Learning: how ideas from the open source movement (e.g., Linux, Red Hat, contributor communities) inform the way we build transparent, collaborative, practitioner-led networks in education.

\- \*\*\[Experiential & Learner-Centered Education\](experiential-learner-centered-education.md)\*\*    
  Describes OWL’s stance on experiential learning as an umbrella for project-based, problem-based, career-connected, community-based, and other authentic learning models—and what that means for daily practice in schools.

\- \*\*\[Competency-Based Education (CBE)\](competency-based-education.md)\*\*    
  Outlines how OWL understands CBE, including our commitments around equity, transparency of learning goals, meaningful evidence of learning, and flexible pathways for students.

As we grow, this section may also include perspectives on topics such as assessment, AI in education, mental health and SEL, and regional resilience. Each piece is intended to be:

\- \*\*Grounded in research and practice\*\* — informed by both the field and our work with schools and districts.  
\- \*\*Clear and usable\*\* — something educators and partners can actually apply in their own context.  
\- \*\*Aligned with our core documents\*\* — especially \[Our Purpose\](../about-owl/our-purpose.md), \[Our Culture\](../about-owl/our-culture.md), and \[Our Approach\](../about-owl/our-approach.md). :contentReference\[oaicite:1\]{index=1}  

Together, these positions and perspectives offer a deeper look at the ideas underneath our projects—and invite partners to critique, remix, and improve them alongside us.
