### **PURPOSE**

This document outlines OWL’s shared expectations for collaboration—within our internal team and with the schools, districts, and partners we serve. It reinforces our commitment to collective leadership, psychological safety, and results-driven teamwork rooted in empathy, trust, and clarity.

Our norms reflect OWL’s identity as a team of “warm demanders”—people who lead with deep care *and* high expectations. Whether facilitating a partner workshop or moving an internal project sprint forward, we aim to balance humility with boldness, flexibility with follow-through, and support with strong accountability.

This document highlights how we prepare, participate, and engage across all forms of collaboration. Formal systems for team meetings, sprints, and Agile cycles will be outlined in the internal SOP: “Collaboration Systems & Meeting Structures.”

### **VALUE ADDED MEETINGS**

We approach meetings like we approach all the work we do: with intention. Not every task requires live collaboration. If the purpose is to inform, reflect, or gather input asynchronously, we default to Slack, Productive, or shared docs. Live time is reserved for effectively moving the work forward.

Core Expectations for Internal Meetings:

* Start and end on time. Everyone’s time is valuable—respect the block.  
* Publish an agenda in advance. Even 24–48 hours ahead makes a difference. Agendas should include a clear outcome or decision point—not just discussion topics.  
* Apply the “two-pizza rule.” If a meeting needs more than 5–6 people to be productive, it may need to be broken into smaller sessions or redesigned.  
* Default to 30-45 minutes. Extend to 60 only if deeper collaboration is clearly needed.  
* Document in real-time. Use a shared Google Doc or meeting tracker to log decisions, parking lot items, and assigned action steps.  
* Minimize passive attendance. If you’re not adding or receiving value in real-time, feel free to step away and catch up async.

Here’s an Agile-Aligned Sample Agenda:

1. Quick check-in or framing (1–3 min)  
2. Review of priorities: What’s in motion? What’s stuck?  
3. Decision points: What needs input or finalization?  
4. Clarifications or feedback requests  
5. Review action items & assign follow-ups

### **COLLABORATION NORMS \- HOW WE WORK TOGETHER**

Our work isn’t just about tasks—it’s about building the relationships that make trust, creativity, and impact possible. These norms guide how we engage as co-learners and collaborators to create the kind of organizational effectiveness and culture where people and ideas flourish:

* Be fully present. Silence notifications, close other tabs, and bring your focus.  
* Be curious before critical. Use active listening and then ask questions to understand, not just to respond.  
* Focus on the work. Engage ideas, not personalities.  
* Use “step up / step back.” Monitor airtime and make room for all voices.  
* Speak plainly. Minimize jargon and acronyms unless context is provided.  
* Check your assumptions. About tone, intent, urgency, or experience.  
* Name what’s unspoken. Raise “stuck” moments or tensions when they surface—respectfully and clearly.  
* Model feedback as a gift. Give it timely, constructively, and often. Receive it with openness.

In every meeting, every sprint, and every project cycle, our goal is to build alignment and momentum, not just consensus.

### **EXTERNAL COLLABORATION: FACILITATING WITH INTENT AND EFFECTIVENESS**

When we step into workshops, design sprints, or strategy sessions with clients and partners, we’re not just leading content, we’re modeling culture. OWL facilitators are expected to operate as [warm demanders](https://resources.corwin.com/sites/default/files/13._figure_6.2_warm_demander_chart.pdf) in external engagements: combining structure with humanity, holding space for multiple perspectives, and keeping the work on track.

In facilitation spaces, we:

* Hold both structure and flexibility. Participants should always know why we’re doing something—and feel safe to ask why not.  
* Set and revisit norms. Use visible norms like “step up/step back,” “embrace non-closure,” and “critique the work, not the person.”  
* Center belonging. Design for multiple modes of participation—voice, chat, sticky notes, silent reflection, and visuals.  
*   
* Invite productive discomfort. Normalize critical reflection without requiring forced vulnerability.  
* Model shared responsibility. If we want collaborative classrooms, we have to lead collaborative rooms.

#### **Suggested Workshop Norms:**

* Take care of yourself and each other  
* Be fully present  
* Embrace productive struggle  
* Critique the work, not the person  
* Step up/Step back  
* Embrace and accept non-closure   
* Practice “[Yes, and…](https://medium.com/improv4/saying-yes-and-a-principle-for-improv-business-life-fd050bccf7e3)” 

#### **Tech Etiquette (Virtual Sessions):**

* Keep your camera on when possible—it helps humanize the space  
* Use chat actively to uplift quiet voices or affirm contributions  
* Avoid multitasking (unless life or caregiving happens—we get it)  
* Use a tidy background and steady framing to reduce distractions  
* Have shared tools ready (e.g. sticky notes, reflection journal, Jamboard, Pear Deck, etc.)

Remember that strong facilitation is an act of strong leadership. It’s not just about what we deliver, it’s about what we help others see in themselves. The above norms provide a framework that enables us to model how we live OWL’s mission, treating collaboration as a shared craft. As such, we revisit, revise, and re-commit to these norms regularly, knowing that they help us show up with purpose, generosity, and courage in every space we enter.
