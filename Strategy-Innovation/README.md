# Strategy & Innovation

This section houses OWL’s core strategy and innovation frameworks, including our continuous improvement practices, learning organization philosophy, Agile workflow models, and strategic plan tools.

It is actively maintained by the **Director of Strategy & Innovation**, who serves as the steward for all content in this folder. As such, any proposed edits or additions should be coordinated with that Director for alignment, accuracy, and approval prior to integration.

The Director of Strategy & Innovation leads efforts that ensure OWL remains a forward-thinking, learning-centered organization. This includes:

- Advancing and iterating OWL’s **strategic plan**, theory of change, and innovation roadmap  
- Supporting the development of **internal systems** that enable adaptive learning, distributed leadership, and organizational transparency  
- Leading the design of OWL’s **operational rhythms**, including Agile workflows, retrospectives, and improvement cycles  
- Embedding OWL’s design thinking practices into both team collaboration and partner-facing services  
- Developing resources that support **innovation facilitation**, knowledge management, and R&D

While this folder may intersect with documents maintained in the **Operations & Finance** section (particularly around SOPs, feedback loops, and internal systems), the materials found here are specifically centered on OWL’s *adaptive capacity* as a learning organization—ensuring that strategy, culture, and operations evolve together with coherence and purpose.

Refer to OWL’s [Organizational Chart](../Governance/org-chart.pdf) for clarity on who currently serves in this role, or contact any Director for guidance.
