## Purpose (what this role exists to achieve)
Steward OWL’s long-term strategy and learning culture; convert values into simple operating guardrails; ensure our distributed leadership model works in real life—so we decide clearly, deliver consistently, and improve continuously.

## What success looks like (core outcomes)
- **Aligned strategy:** A living org strategy and theory of change that guides choices and resourcing.
- **Reliable decisions:** Decision Ladder + RACI-S practiced org-wide; crisp “one A” calls logged in **#decision_log**.
- **Evergreen systems:** SOPs and tools that are lightweight, current, and actually used.
- **Evidence & learning:** Bright Spots/Proof Points and quarterly syntheses that inform delivery, visibility, and development.
- **Financial discipline:** ROI Guardrail is understood, applied, and reflected in go/no-go calls and policy.

## Decision rights & guardrails (snapshot)
- **One “A” rule:** D-OSL is **Accountable** for tool/process adoption, SOP/policy updates, portfolio/PM assignment, and risk escalation/crisis response (mission-critical). **Consulted** = DFIO/DPD/DPIV as appropriate.
- **ROI Guardrail:** Commit only if **deposit in hand**, **≥minimum margin**, **pass-throughs matched to receipts**, **or** there’s a **funded path ≤90 days**; exceptions are explicit strategic investments logged in **#decision_log**.
- **Logging:** Post Strategic/Tactical outcomes (3–5 lines: summary, RACI-S, why it matters, next step, link).

## Scope of work (high-signal summary)
- **Strategy & governance:** Maintain org strategy, Decision Ladder, and **Top Decisions RACI-S**; ensure exactly one **A** per decision.
- **Organizational learning & artifacts:** Define evidence standards and cadences (Bright Spots/Proof Points); synthesize quarterly learning.
- **SOPs & knowledge architecture:** Keep SOP/Playbook/GitBook coherent; retire “transition” content on schedule; publish diffs.
- **Innovation & improvement:** Time-box pilots/experiments; publish adopt/decline decisions with short retros.
- **Board & governance cadence:** Coordinate board-facing strategy info (budget adoption, audit/policy reviews, mission-critical approvals).

## Interfaces (who you co-design with)
- **DFO — Finance & Operations:** Strategy ↔ budget/risk alignment; tool administration; compliance posture.
- **DPIV — Program Impact & Visibility:** Strategy ↔ program design and artifacts; approve major campaigns with brand risk.
- **PMs & Fellows — Site Delivery:** Apply SOPs locally; surface improvements; participate in pilots; share evidence.

## KPIs & review cadence
- **Weekly:** Scrum KPI flash; Grants & Partnerships (ROI) slot; blockers/swarms; decisions to log.
- **Monthly:** Strategy session (leading indicators, policy diffs, adopt/decline notes), SOP freshness check.
- **Quarterly:** Strategy progress (OKR scores), artifact roll-up, decision practices adoption (#decision_log usage), org health (capacity buffer/WIP).

## Operating discipline (always)
Use Slack for essential comms; keep Productive current; maintain file hygiene; submit receipts/billables promptly; keep calendars accurate (with “sub plan” when OOO); status format: **Here’s where we are → Here’s the gap → Here’s the next step.**

## Director-as-PM expectation (when applicable)
When serving as PM for a region/portfolio, **earn your keep**: cover salary (and attributable overhead) **monthly** through billable service and/or funded grants/contracts within the assigned portfolio.

## RACI-S snapshot (common calls)
- **Tool/Process Adoption:** **A = D-OSL**, R = DFIO (roll-out/admin), C = DPIV/PMs, I = Team.
- **Risk Escalation / Crisis (mission-critical):** **A = D-OSL**, C = DFO/DPIV, I = Board as required.
- **Portfolio/PM Assignment:** **A = D-OSL**, C = DFO/DPIV, I = Team.
- **Public Campaign (strategy-heavy):** **A = DPIV**, C = D-OSL/DFO (D-OSL ensures alignment).
- **Grant/MOU (precedent/mission fit):** **A = D-OSL**, C = DFO/DPIV (D-OSL ensures precedent is honored).
