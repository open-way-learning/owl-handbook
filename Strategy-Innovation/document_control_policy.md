## **OWL Document Control Policy**

**Owner:** Director of Finance & Operations (DFO) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff, partners, and stakeholders

---
### **Purpose**

This procedure codifies how Open Way Learning manages its internal and external documents using a dual-platform approach:

* **GitHub/GitBook** is used for finalized, version-controlled documentation and internal strategic resources. It serves as the official source for OWL’s policies, templates, and core systems.  
* **Google Drive** is used for flexible, collaborative development, including works in progress, workshop slide decks, team-generated tools, reference documents from other organizations, media from OWL events, and most external-facing materials intended for clients, partners, or the public.

The goal of this approach is to:

* Establish a single source of truth for OWL’s internal systems and decision-making frameworks  
* Enable collaboration and reuse of high-quality resources  
* Maintain transparency, consistency, and accountability across all team workflows

Note that OWL’s Employee Handbook is the primary set of documents included in the GitBook platform and this is more than a policy archive \- it serves as a living, public-facing reflection of OWL’s culture, grounded in collective leadership, open-source principles, and radical transparency. It is designed for ongoing iteration and shared ownership, not as a static PDF. The Handbook outlines how OWL operates, why it does so, and the values behind those decisions. Suggestions for updates are welcomed and can be submitted via GitBook comments or GitHub pull requests per the workflow outlined in this procedure.

### **Why GitHub/GitBook?**

While Google Drive is useful for real-time collaboration, OWL uses GitHub \+ GitBook to manage finalized documentation because it offers a much clearer and more reliable way to track changes over time. In Google Drive, version history only shows who made edits and when, but not exactly what was changed. GitHub, by contrast, shows the specific lines of text that were added, deleted, or edited in each update. This makes it easy to see how a document has evolved, who contributed what, and why changes were made, helping prevent confusion or duplication when multiple people are working on important documents.

We also use GitHub in combination with GitBook because together they offer a clean, accessible interface for most team members (GitBook), while supporting powerful behind-the-scenes version control and editing features for those with more technical skills (GitHub). Content is stored in a simple format called Markdown (.md), which is easy to read even in raw form, works across any platform, and can be quickly converted into polished webpages, PDFs, or other formats. For most team members, interacting with GitBook is as simple as reading or suggesting edits to a web-based handbook. For tech-savvy contributors, Markdown files can be edited directly in GitHub to ensure everything stays organized, up to date, and properly formatted. Refer to Appendix 5 (Basic Git Commands) if you wish to make contributions directly in GitHub and not via GitBook.

### **System Overview:**

#### **GitBook (Primary, Finalized, Internal-Facing Content)**

GitBook serves as our official documents that are appropriate for public or team-wide access. It is a living, version-controlled system for finalized, policy-aligned documents that includes:

* OWL Employee Handbook  
* Governance, finance, HR, and strategic policy documents  
* Reusable tool (e.g. partner/client engagement protocols, standardized templates, contractor terms, facilitation guides, etc.)

#### **Google Drive (Secondary, Collaborative Workspace for Client-Facing Resources)**

This is the organization’s working area for drafts, planning, peer-generated content, and active collaboration. It also includes confidential documents such as personnel records that are stored in secure folders on the Drive platform. For example, these documents include:

* Session slide decks and working agendas  
* Peer-curated workshop resources and tools  
* Early-stage drafts of policies, proposals, or templates  
* Contextual resources not intended for publication

An example that highlights the difference between the above platforms would be the OWL Travel Policy as a finalized official document that is maintained and controlled in GitBook, while the “June 2024 STEM PD Slide Deck” would live in Drive as a reference document that could be used and remixed for future STEM workshops. 

*Refer to Appendix 1 for Decision Criteria that will help determine the proper location for any document within the above dual system.*

### **Roles and Responsibilities**

| Role | Responsibility |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Director of Strategy & Innovation** | Top-level oversight of the development and refinement of OWL's documentation ecosystem as described in this procedure \- i.e. the migration and set-up phase. Maintains this procedure and ensures adoption and alignment across systems. Exercises a gradual release of responsibility for “run & maintain” ownership to DFO by January 2026\. |
| **Director of Finance & Operations** | Maintains collaborative responsibility for this procedure in the transition to the GitHub/GitBook and revised Google Drive architecture and format. Assuming full, top level oversight by January 2026\. |
| **Document Stewards** *(Directors & Managers)* | Primary content gatekeepers for their areas of responsibility (Development, Outreach, Operations, etc.). Stewards review and approve proposed changes to official OWL procedures and policies on the GitHub/GitBook platform per the applicable RACI process and other collaborative processes and standards. |
| **Manager of Finance, HR, & Communications** | Initiates a quarterly review of all Google Drive documents per the “Quarterly Cleanup Procedure” section of this document. |
| **Tech Leads (***GitHub-Savvy Staff***)** | Implement official wording and format changes in GitHub after steward approval, including verifying Markdown formatting, commits, SUMMARY.md updates, and GitBook integration. In general, Stewards and Tech Leads are not the same person for any applicable document change.  |
| **All OWL Team Members** | Tag documents, follow naming protocols, and participate in cleanup cycles and contribution workflows. |

### **Document Contribution and Publication Workflow**

This section outlines how OWL team members can create, update, or publish documents across our dual-platform system. It includes steps for drafting new materials, proposing revisions to official documents, and managing working resources stored in Google Drive.

#### **1\. Proposing and Publishing a New Official Document (GitBook)**

Use this workflow when creating a new internal policy, template, or resource intended for organization-wide use and publication in GitBook:

1. **Draft the Resource:** Begin in Google Drive using a clear title per the following naming convention (e.g. DRAFT \- Hiring Rubric – v1). Be sure it is located in the appropriate subfolders for the topic in question (e.g. Tools / Learner-Centered Resources / Experiential Learning / PBL Rubrics”).

2. **Engage Early Feedback:** Share your draft with colleagues, including the relevant Steward for input and ideas before initiating a formal review. Include a suggested timeline, as needed (light wording changes to major revision).

3. **Submit for Steward Review:** When the document is ready for formal consideration, notify the designated Steward (Director/Manager responsible for that area). They will determine whether it aligns with OWL’s values and policies, is generalizable enough to warrant being a new document, and whether it meets OWL’s minimum essential standards for quality, clarity, and format.

4. **Approval & Markdown Conversion:** Once approved, the document is renamed (remove “DRAFT” and version reference in the title) and is converted into Markdown (.md) format. If needed, a Tech Lead can then assist with formatting so that it can be saved in the appropriate GitHub folder and the SUMMARY.md updated to reflect its official location in GitBook.

5. **Verification in GitBook:** The Steward and/or Tech Lead confirms formatting, accessibility, title consistency, and links to be sure it is now an official OWL document.

6. **Clean Up in Google Drive:** Finalized documents published to GitBook are also saved as a view-only reference copy in the “On GitHub” folder in the OWL Google Drive. *This folder should not be edited directly \- it exists to help non-technical users locate and review the most current approved version in a familiar format.*

#### **2\. Suggesting Revisions to an Existing GitBook Document**

In alignment with the open-source philosophy described in the Employee Handbook’s introduction, any OWL team member is encouraged to propose updates or improvements to official OWL documents. The preferred method is to suggest changes directly in GitBook using the commenting feature. Use the following workflow whenever you believe an existing document needs clarification, correction, or updates:

1. **Identify the Document:** Note the title, GitBook location, and the specific section(s) to revise.

2. **Make a Suggestion:** 

   * Preferred method: Visit the GitBook page, highlight the relevant text, and click “Comment” to leave your suggestion.  
   * For larger edits: Copy the text into a Google Doc, use “Suggesting Mode” to propose changes, and share the document with the appropriate Steward.  
   * For advanced users: Submit a GitHub pull request using the Markdown workflow described in Appendix 5\.  
     *Regardless of the method used, always include enough detail to explain what you’re recommending, why it matters, and if possible, propose revised wording.*  
3. **Collaborate with the Steward:** The Steward may invite others to review or co-edit, especially for significant changes. All final decisions will follow OWL’s Approach to Collective Leadership and Decision Making procedure (in GitBook), ensuring inclusive input and clear accountability. The timeline for this process should be a consensus between the Steward and the person(s) initiating the change.

4. **Approval & GitHub Update:** Once finalized, the Steward requests support from a Tech Lead (if needed) to implement the change in GitHub and update the SUMMARY.md, as applicable.

5. **Confirmation:** After the changes are made and syncing is complete between GitHub and GitBook, the Steward will confirm the update appears properly in GitBook and all links work as intended.

**Important:** The above process ensures automatic version control. Each change made in GitHub is saved with a full history of what was updated, when it was changed, and by whom. This eliminates the common confusion in Google Drive about which version is the latest or most accurate. As such, synced GitBook documents always reflect the most current, approved version in a transparent and trackable way.

**Additional GitBook Maintenance Guidelines:**

* All new .md files must be referenced in the SUMMARY.md file to appear in GitBook’s sidebar navigation  
* Each folder in GitHub must include a README.md file explaining its structure and contents  
* Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g. employee-orientation.md) for all Markdown documents  
* Keep GitBook folder structure logically aligned with OWL’s team areas and decision-making framework  
* When appropriate, link GitBook entries to companion Google Drive folders containing editable or supporting resources

#### **3\. Managing Working Documents in Google Drive**

Use this guidance for using and updating documents that remain in Drive as collaborative, client-facing, or context-specific resources:

1. **Organize from the Start:** Choose the correct folder (e.g. “External Partners & Clients” or “Facilitator Resources”). Use a clear, standardized title per the Naming Convention section in Appendix 2 (e.g. “RESOURCE \-  SEL Journaling Protocol – MS,” or “SLIDE DECK \- Terre Haute District PD Session – Feb 2024”)

2. **Collaborate Freely:** Documents on the OWL Drive are meant to be helpful and dynamic resources. Anyone can add comments, create iterations, or simply reference them without worrying about version control. Note: While these documents are more flexible and informal than GitBook entries, individuals and teams should still use care to avoid overwriting others’ edits, losing key context, or letting too many versions proliferate. If you're unsure whether to create a new version or update an existing one, consult the folder’s Steward or review the document’s revision history.

3. **Avoid Duplication:** Before creating a new resource, always be sure to search the OWL Drive and/or ask colleagues about possible resources in order to avoid duplicating a similar document. As a preventive measure, team members are encouraged to “search before you store.” Before uploading or creating a document, use keyword searches or browse the relevant folders to check whether something similar already exists. This reduces clutter, improves consistency, and helps ensure the team builds on existing work rather than starting from scratch.

4. **Flag Final Resources:** If a Drive-based document becomes widely reused or represents a best practice that should be codified into OWL’s official methods, notify the appropriate Steward for possible GitBook publication (see Workflow \#1 above).

5. **Broad vs. Deep:** In line with best practices for digital file management, OWL prioritizes a folder structure that is broad but not deep, favoring clear, consistently labeled top-level folders over complex subfolder nesting. When creating new subfolders, team members should avoid going more than three to four levels deep, as excessive nesting makes it harder to locate documents and increases the risk of duplication. 

6. **Folder Descriptions:** To simplify navigation, all shared folders should include a brief “README” or description under “Folder Information” to explain what the folder contains and how it is used.

Note: When referencing GitBook documents from a Google Doc, include a direct hyperlink to the specific GitBook page and identify it clearly as the official version (e.g. *“Refer to the official OWL Travel Policy in GitBook”*). This ensures team members know where to find the most current and approved version, and prevents duplication or outdated copies from being circulated.

### **Quarterly Cleanup Procedure**

To keep OWL’s shared Google Drive organized, useful, and easy to navigate, the team follows a quarterly cleanup cycle designed to reduce clutter, improve searchability, and ensure version clarity. This routine prevents outdated materials from cluttering active folders and minimizes confusion about which documents are current or approved.

The cleanup process is initiated by the Manager of Finance, HR, and Communications during the months of February, May, August, and November. It includes structured review of Google Drive materials, especially those in “To File,” project-specific folders, and older or seldom-used resources.

A key feature of this system is OWL’s shared “To File” folder, which serves as a temporary holding space for incoming or miscellaneous documents that haven’t yet been properly categorized. Team members should use this space to drop materials they believe may be useful but aren’t sure where to place. This could include external resources, draft tools, or slides from a recent engagement. If the material is deemed relevant and high quality, it will be reviewed and either archived, formally filed, or flagged for GitBook publication.

To keep the quarterly effort manageable, OWL does not attempt to audit every document in the Drive during each cycle. Instead, each cleanup focuses on a priority subset, starting with the contents of the “To File” folder. In addition to this, Stewards or designated reviewers may choose to prioritize:

* Folders with known duplication or outdated files  
* Project folders from completed initiatives  
* Resource banks that haven’t been reviewed in over 6 months  
* Any folder flagged by team members or raised in team meetings

At the start of each cycle, a new temporary cleanup folder is created and labeled by month (e.g. \!Drive Cleanup Queue – August 2025). Within that folder, three temporary triage subfolders are created:

* \[ARCHIVE\] – for files that are no longer active but may be useful for historical reference  
* \[TO MOVE TO GITHUB\] – for finalized resources that meet OWL standards and are ready for GitBook publication  
* \[ACTIVE \- TO FILE\] – for documents still in use but needing to be properly renamed and relocated

These folders are temporary staging areas for cleanup only. Final decisions about filing, archiving, or publication are made by the appropriate Steward(s) and executed before the end of the quarter.

Any documents that remain in “To File” or other staging areas for more than three months will be reviewed and either moved, archived, or removed to prevent ongoing clutter.

#### **Cleanup Workflow Steps**

1. Create a temporary cleanup folder: \!Drive Cleanup Queue – \[Month Year\]  
2. Team members and Stewards move uncertain or outdated files into the cleanup queue folder.  
3. Reviewers sort files into one of the triage folders:  
   * \[ARCHIVE\]  
   * \[TO MOVE TO GITHUB\]  
   * \[ACTIVE \- TO FILE\]  
4. Files are renamed and relocated into their long-term homes in the main Drive or GitHub, following OWL’s naming convention and organization.  
5. Unresolved files or unclear ownership are flagged for discussion or team review.

### **Appendix 1 \- Decision Criteria: What Belongs Where?**

| Question to Ask | If YES → | If NO → |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| Is this the final, approved version of an OWL-wide policy, protocol, or resource intended for team-wide or public reference? | GitBook | Google Drive |
| Will it be reused across schools, clients, or team members? | GitBook | Google Drive |
| Does it require version control or formal stewardship? | GitBook | Google Drive |
| Is it still a draft, tailored to a specific project, or actively evolving? | Google Drive | GitBook |
| Does it contain personally identifiable information (PII), compensation or HR records, contract terms, or proprietary pricing data? | Google Drive (restricted access)\* | GitBook |

*\*Confidential Note: OWL is committed to open-source transparency, but not at the expense of personal privacy or proprietary integrity. All sensitive documents, such as personnel files, salary information, vendor contracts, and private partner agreements, must remain in restricted-access folders in Google Drive and should never be uploaded to GitHub or GitBook.*

### **What to Do If It's in the Overlap:**

Some documents may sit in the gray area between platforms—for example, a template that’s still evolving, or a shared tool that’s becoming a standard. In these cases:

1. **Collaborate with a Teammate or Steward \-** Talk through whether the document is ready for GitBook or should remain flexible in Drive.  
2. **Use the RACI Framework \-** When multiple teams or leadership areas are affected, use OWL’s Collective Leadership Procedure to clarify ownership and approval roles.  
3. **Use “To File” as a Holding Zone \-** If unsure, store the document in the primary “To File” folder on the OWL Drive and flag it for review during the next quarterly cleanup.  
4. **Link Dual Versions Carefully \-** If both a finalized GitBook version and an editable Drive version are needed, link the two clearly and maintain version consistency, with Steward oversight.

### **Appendix 2 \- File/Folder Naming Convention**

Consistent file naming helps everyone at OWL quickly locate resources without needing to open multiple documents. A clear, structured title provides instant context, improves searchability across Google Drive (especially in shared team folders), and reduces confusion. A strong file name should answer three key questions:

**What is it?** • **Who is it for?** • **When or where was it used?**

OWL’s naming convention, described below, is designed to reflect this by consistently communicating the document’s type, audience, and context.

#### **Standard Format:**

\[TYPE\] Topic – Context or Use – (Optional: Date or Version)

| Type | Example File Name |
| ----- | ----- |
| Template | \[TEMPLATE\] Proposal Template – District Planning |
| Slide Deck | \[SLIDE DECK\] SC STEM & PBL Workshop – Fall 2024 |
| Resource | \[RESOURCE\] STEM Maturity Model \- V4 |
| Archive | \[ARCHIVE\] Terre Haute Elementary School Field Notes 2022 |

#### **Keyword Guidance for Naming**

To improve searchability and prevent duplication, include the following kinds of descriptive tags in your file name when relevant:

* **Grade Level** → K–5, MS (Middle School), HS (High School)  
* **Subject Area** → Math, Science, ELA, SEL, CTE  
* **Audience or Use** → District Leaders, Facilitators, Students  
* **Resource Type** → Slide Deck, Worksheet, Protocol, Agenda  
* **Date or Version** → Jan 2024, v2.1, SY2023–24

#### **Example Titles Using Best Practices**

* \[RESOURCE\] MS Science – Water Quality Lab – v1  
* \[SLIDE DECK\] HS Math PD – Inquiry Practices – Jan 2024  
* \[TEMPLATE\] ELA Student Reflection – Grade 9

These examples make it easier for colleagues to locate documents via Drive search—even if they weren’t involved in creating them.

Whenever possible, match the file name to a consistent format used across OWL documents. This not only improves Drive search results but also enables team members to sort by filename to quickly group related resources. If a document has gone through multiple drafts or iterations, include the version number or date in the title rather than duplicating the file. Avoid storing more than one active version of the same document in the same folder. If needed, use comments or suggestion mode to update in place.

#### **What to Avoid**

Avoid vague or personal file names that give no searchable context, such as:

* "Workshop Notes"  
* "New Template"  
* "Session Slides – Ben"  
* "Copy of Final Draft"

These require users to open the file to determine its relevance, which slows collaboration and increases the risk of using outdated materials.

**Rule of Thumb:**  When naming or saving a file, ask: 

*“If someone else needed to find this six months from now, what keywords would help them locate it quickly?”*

**Folder Naming Convention**

Just like individual file names, folder names should be clear, descriptive, and consistently formatted. Avoid vague titles like “Misc,” “New Folder,” or personal names (e.g. “George’s Stuff”). Each folder name should reflect its contents and purpose, ideally using similar conventions to OWL file names, such as including audience, subject area, or date range when relevant. For example:

* PBL Workshop Slide Decks – 2023–24  
* STEM Resources – MS Science  
* Archived Partner Files – SY2021–22  
* District Planning Templates

When in doubt, use neutral, searchable terms and check whether a similar folder already exists before creating a new one.

### **Appendix 3: OWL Drive Folder Structure**

#### **Primary OWL Google Drive Folders:**

1. Internal Business & Ops  
2. External Partners & Clients  
3. Facilitator Resources  
4. To File (*temporary staging folder for sorting*)

#### **Subfolder Example (from “Facilitator Resources” above):**

* General Education Resources  
* Learner-Centered Resources  
* Curriculum-Specific Resources  
* Client-Facing Resources

Each primary folder in the OWL Drive includes a brief description under its “Folder Information.” These descriptions should be kept up to date by the Steward of that folder’s contents and can include tips on how the folder is used, naming expectations, or links to commonly referenced templates. This ensures anyone accessing the folder, whether new to OWL or part of a partner team, has immediate context on how to use the contents effectively.

#### **Folder README Files (Required for Key Folders)**

Because Google Drive does not retain folder descriptions in a way that is visible to all users, OWL uses a standardized **README** file inside each major folder to provide clarity and context.

A README – Folder Overview document should be placed at the top of all key shared folders, including all top level and second level folders. Each README should briefly explain:

* The **purpose** of the folder  
* The **types of documents** it contains  
* The **role responsible** for maintaining the folder (i.e. the Steward)  
* Any important **naming conventions**, subfolder logic, or access notes

This practice ensures that any team member—new or existing—can immediately understand the folder’s contents and intended use without needing to ask or guess.

**Tip:** Use a consistent format and place “README” at the top of the folder by prefixing the title with an asterisk (\*) \- e.g. \*README – Folder Overview.

### **Appendix 4: GitBook Folder Overview** 

The list below reflects the current structure of OWL’s GitBook documentation, as defined by the SUMMARY.md file in our GitHub repository. GitBook is the platform OWL uses to publish and maintain official, version-controlled documents (such as policies, templates, and strategic guides). Each entry in this list represents a folder or subpage that appears in the GitBook sidebar navigation.

For most OWL team members, GitBook serves as a web-based handbook—easy to read and navigate without requiring any technical skills. For Tech Leads and Stewards, this folder structure is maintained and updated through GitHub to ensure clarity, consistency, and logical alignment with OWL’s internal organizational framework.

Use this appendix to understand where a particular document “lives” in GitBook and how to reference or request updates to the official version.

### **Appendix 5: Basic Git Workflow for OWL Contributions**

*Optional use for GitHub-savvy contributors and Tech Leads*

While most OWL team members contribute to official documentation through Google Docs suggestions or GitBook comments, some contributors, particularly Tech Leads, may prefer or need to work directly in GitHub using Markdown (.md) files.

This appendix provides a simplified, OWL-specific Git workflow for contributors comfortable with Git or interested in learning. It is not a comprehensive Git training resource but includes references for further learning.

Note: Direct GitHub editing is not required for most users. Follow this process *only if* you are editing Markdown files yourself rather than submitting edits through a Steward or via GitBook.

**Prerequisites**

* Git installed on your computer: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)  
* OWL GitHub repository cloned locally: [Cloning Repos](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)  
* Understanding of basic Git concepts such as branches and pull requests: [Intro to Branching](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

**OWL GitHub Contribution Workflow**

1. Get the latest version from GitHub to ensure your local version is current with the latest updates on GitHub.  
   * git checkout main    
   * git pull origin main  
2. Create a new branch for your update. Use clear branch names, e.g. update-facilitator-guide-v2 or clarify-invoice-policy.  
   * git checkout \-b your-branch-name  
3. Edit Markdown Files \- Make changes in your preferred Markdown editor (e.g. VS Code, Obsidian). Ensure:  
   * File names use lowercase with hyphens (e.g. travel-policy.md)  
   * You update any affected README.md or SUMMARY.md files if structure/navigation is changed  
4. Stage and commit your changes. Write meaningful commit messages. Each commit becomes a permanent, trackable entry in OWL’s version history.  
   * git add .    
   * git commit \-m "Clarify reimbursement policy in section 3.2"  
5. Push your branch to GitHub  
   * git push origin your-branch-name  
6. Create a Pull Request (PR)  
   * Go to OWL’s GitHub repository in your browser  
   * Click "**Compare & Pull Request**"  
   * In the PR description:  
     * Summarize your changes clearly  
     * Tag the relevant Document Steward and/or Tech Lead  
     * Mention any structural changes (e.g., “Added new entry to SUMMARY.md”)

**Responsibilities of a Tech Lead**

For approved changes requiring GitHub integration:

* Format the Markdown file(s) to OWL standards  
* Ensure the document appears correctly in GitBook, including links, headings, and side navigation (SUMMARY.md)  
* Validate that GitBook sync reflects the correct content and is accessible via direct link  
* Confirm with the Steward that the final update is ready for team reference
