**OWL’s Approach to Collective Leadership and Decision Making**

Open Way Learning embraces a collective leadership model that intentionally departs from traditional hierarchy employed by other organizations. Inspired by *The Open Organization* (Whitehurst), *Drive* (Pink), and *Open Up, Education\!* (Owens & Haigler), we treat leadership as a practice, not a position \- one grounded in transparency, purpose, distributed authority, agile learning, and psychological safety. This procedure is the bedrock for how we routinely and consistently decide, deliver, and improve as a small, nimble nonprofit. It exists so anyone at OWL can confidently lead a decision without waiting for permission, while also staying aligned to shared guardrails, systems, and mission.

**Why this matters:** Collective leadership only works when decision protocols are clear, our work is open and transparent, and follow-through is predictable and reliable. What follows turns our values into day-to-day practice so we can move nimbly and quickly while always keeping our promises to each other and our partners.

**How to use this document (at a glance):**

* **Start with the Quickstart.** It shows the core habits, rituals, and tools we use every week to make decisions. These include the **Decision Ladder** (Operational / Tactical / Strategic), the **RACI-S** table, the Slack **\#decision\_log,** communication and documentation system hygiene (e.g. Productive, Slack, GitBook, Drive, etc.), minimum essential ROI guardrails.

* **Use the Top Decisions table.** If you’re unsure who owns a call (pricing, grants, comms, scope, risk, etc.), check the RACI-S table to identify the “single **A**” for that decision type/topic, who to consult, and who to inform. Then post the outcome in **\#decision\_log**.

* **Go deeper with the Appendices:** The appendices are at the end of the document so that the main content is clear and up front. They provide details for more analysis and understanding in order to help drive consistency and effectiveness,  without adding bureaucracy, especially with unique or complex decisions. These include the following: 

  * **Appendix 1 – Collective Leadership Guiding Principles:** More information regarding the why, what, and how behind OWL’s collective leadership ethos.  
  * **Appendix 2 – Decision Types & Methods:** More detail for when to use Delegated Authority, Consent, or Board approval; how to tag Decision Ladder levels and when to log.  
  * **Appendix 3 – Directors ↔ PMs:** Details regarding the key difference between the Director roles and the Program Manager roles \- i.e. who owns strategy & systems (Directors) vs site-level execution (PMs), with escalation triggers.  
  * **Appendix 4 – Example Scenarios:** Short, typical case studies that help the reader see patterns and notes for when and how to use our decision-making tools, including grants, MOUs, events, tools, renewals, etc.   
  * **A note regarding the [Transition Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1_K3aZ09kZ8tUY7qBdKihBY7ncsrsm-geqMERHky0A/edit?usp=sharing)**: Consider this as an additional, complementary, and time-bound appendix to this document for critical role handoffs and interim arrangements during the period of organizational transition from the summer of 2025 through the summer of 2026\. 

# **Quickstart:**

**Why does this document exist?** We lead through distributed authority, transparent systems, and mission alignment. This procedure is the *bedrock* for how we decide, deliver, and improve and should be used as a routine tool for how you make decisions within your role and across the organization’s functions.

**Core habits (at a glance).**

* **Decide and document with clarity.** Use the **Decision Ladder** and **RACI-S** (see below). Log the decision in Slack per the **\#decision\_log**.  
* **Make work visible.** In general, if it’s not in Productive, it doesn’t exist. Use Slack for all essential internal communication. File docs in Google Drive so others can find/use them. Use GitBook (and GitHub for code) for all codified procedures and policies.  
* **Operate with discipline.** Keep receipts/billables current; never have overdue items without initiating a swarm; keep calendars accurate with a “sub plan” when out of the office; and be ready to efficiently share short status updates of your work in scrum meetings: *Here’s where we are → here’s a gap → here’s the next steps*.  
* **Own the bottom line.** Apply the ROI Guardrail: OWL only commits to work that is cash-positive now (deposit in hand, ≥45% margin, pass-throughs matched to receipts) or has a clearly documented, funded path to revenue within 90 days. Everything else pauses unless explicitly approved as a strategic investment by the Director Team.   
* **Earn your keep.** Directors/Program Managers lead their systemic role for the organization and their respective region/portfolio of client facing work, but must *also* consistently deliver the funding to cover their role (and OWL’s essential overhead) per grants, donations, contracts tied to billable work. This is a necessary and essential part of keeping the lights on as an effective nonprofit organization.

## **1\) Decision Modes \+ Decision Ladder** 

**Decision modes:** We use **Consent**, **Consensus**, and **Delegated Authority** \- selected intentionally, based on the applicable level in the following decision ladder.

**OWL’s Decision Ladder (3 levels \+ examples):**

1. **Operational Level:** (individual, well within one’s Roles & Responsibilities; fast & nimble):  
   * **Standard Procedure:** *Owner decides; logs outcome; informs stakeholders.*  
   * **Example:** Moving a delivery date inside scope; swapping a facilitation protocol, etc..   
   * **Mode:** *Delegated Authority* → Log in **\#decision\_log** only if it has broader implications.

2. **Tactical Level:** (cross-role/lane implications):  
   * **Standard Procedure:** *Owner drafts; consults another role or small team; finalizes decision per collaboration; logs.*  
   * **Example:** Adjusting contract deliverables, rebalancing a PM’s capacity, etc.  
   * **Mode:** *Small team collaboration per RACI* → Log in **\#decision\_log**. 

3. **Strategic / Mission-critical Level:**   
   * **Standard Procedure:** *“Accountable” person proposes the decision at hand; Director Team reviews with a goal of consensus; elevate to Board when required; log.*  
   * **Example:** Changing pricing guardrails, multi-year budget shifts, public commitments, grant submissions, etc.  
   * **Mode:** *Director team consultation per RACI* → Log in **\#decision\_log**. 

**After every decision** (how we keep OWL’s work open, disciplined, and mission-aligned):

1. **Document and communicate outcomes** (esp. those marked “I”). This ensures quick learning so that our systems get a little better each time.  
2. **Implement & track** **decision follow-up steps.** Update any applicable Productive cards and tie decision outcomes to any applicable role objectives and/or KPIs for the organization.   
3. **Reflect & improve.** Use monthly strategy meetings to debrief and document key decision impacts (as appropriate).

# **2\) Follow the RACI-S Standard** 

Consistently use the **RACI-S** table below for key decisions required in the organization, as well as other similar scenarios. Reference the appendices for additional detail on how and when to use this table. 

## **RACI-S Format/criteria:**

* **Exactly one “A”** (Accountable) per decision. *Note that while we strive for consensus, the “A” has the final say per their role.*  
* **R** (Responsible) executes the decision (is often also the A);   
* **C** (Consulted) gives input before decision;   
* **I** (Informed) receives outcomes;   
* **S** (Support) co-builds or provides critical resourcing (when applicable).

## **OWL’s RACI-S Table** 

| Decision Area | Accountable (A) | Responsible (R) | Consulted (C) | Informed (I) | Support (S) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Budget Strategy & Financial Oversight**  | **DFO** | DFO | DPIV, D-OSL | Board |  \-  |
| **Contract Pricing & Terms (inside guardrails)** | **DFO** | DFO | PM of record, D-OSL (precedent) | Board (if exception) |   \-  |
| **Go/No-Go on Scope/Precedent/Mission Fit** | **D-OSL** | PM of record | DFO (pricing/terms), DPIV (delivery/ brand)  | Board (if exception) |  \-  |
| **Grant Submissions (final)** | **D-OSL** | PM/DPIV (narrative & submission) | DFO (budget/ compliance) | Team (Board if material) | **DFO** (attachments/ packaging) |
| **PM Region / Portfolio Assignments** | **D-OSL** | D-OSL | DPIV, DFO | Team | **DFO** (calendar/ admin) |
| **Scope Changes (within contract)** | **PM of record** | PM of record | DFO, DPIV | Team | **DFO** (contract/ admin) |
| **Travel Above Budget / Risk-bearing Logistics** | **DFO** | **DFO (or designee)** | PM, D-OSL | Team |  \-  |
| **Hiring / Contractor Adds (Fellows)** | **DFO** | **DFO (or designee)** | DPIV, D-OSL | Team |  \-  |
| **Public Comms & Major Announce- ments** | **DPIV** | DPIV | D-OSL, DFO | Team | **DFO** (channels/ admin) |
| **Tool / Process Adoption (SOP updates)** | **D-OSL** | **DFO** (roll-out/admin) | DFO,  DPIV | Team |  \-  |
| **KPI Set & Quarterly Reviews** | **Each Director (domain)** | Each Director | D-OSL, DFO | Team/Board (as req’d) | **DFO** (dashboards) |
| **Risk Escalation / Crisis Response** | **D-OSL** | D-OSL | DFO,  DPIV | Board | **DFO** (coordination) |
| **Data / Reporting Commitments** | **DPIV** | DPIV | DFO, D-OSL | Team/ Funders | **DFO** (systems/ artifacts) |

**Role keys:** 

* D-OSL \= Director of Organizational Strategy & Learning;   
* DFO \= Director of Finance & Operations;   
* DPIV \= Director of Program Impact & Visibility;   
* PM \= Program Manager of record.

# **3\) Decision Log Protocol**

Every decision above the Operational level is logged in the Slack **\#decision\_log** per this Rule of Thumb: *If a decision  is likely to change someone else’s plan, money, timeline, promise, or risk \- log it. Use the “5-R” test below:* 

Log it when **≥1** of these is true:

1. **Reach** — affects another person/role, a partner, or a deadline.  
2. **Resources** — touches budget, travel, staffing, or billables.  
3. **Risk** — creates legal, safety, brand, or delivery risk.  
4. **Reversibility** — hard to undo (a “one-way door”).  
5. **Reputation/Record** — sets a precedent or external commitment.

**Examples**

* **No log (Operational, reversible):** swap an icebreaker, revise a slide deck, reorder an activity in the same session. If it only affects how *you* deliver (and is easily reversible), no log.  
* **Log (Tactical):** move a workshop date, reassign PM capacity, change scope/deliverables, request travel above budget, shift invoicing timing, ask others for \>30 minutes of work.  
* **Log (Strategic):** price/contract exceptions, grant submissions, public announcements, KPIs/OKRs changes, risk escalations.

When you log something in Slack’s \#decision\_log channel, use the following format:

* **Title:** Clear and descriptive title  
* **Owner (A):** Decision’s owner \- Name/Role  
* **Who’s involved (as applicable):** R / C / I / S (names)  
* **Decision Summary:** Brief description of what was decided (what happens now), along with applicable details (due date, who’s on point, next steps, etc.). Link to Productive card or other doc, as applicable.

# Example: DECISION (Tactical): Shift WNCRP workshop sequence by 2 weeks. A: DPIV. R: PM (Wes). C: DFO, D-OSL. I: Partners. Outcome: New dates confirmed; Productive updated; comms out by Fri.

***If in doubt, log \- short and clear beats invisible and assumed.***

# **4\) Operating Discipline Checklist** 

OWL operates with a small, nimble team in a collective (non-hierarchical) manner. As such, we must be agile at scale in order to consistently deliver high quality, mission-driven work. This requires a high degree of operating discipline that matches creativity with consistent habits:

* **Use Slack** for essential internal communication and **\#decision\_log** for key decisions. No side channels for the organization’s essential work.  
* **Keep Productive current.** Cards are always updated before the weekly scrum; follow the “no shadow work” principle.  
* **Maintain file hygiene.** Use shared folders, naming conventions, and keep current SOPs/Playbooks codified in GitBook so others can see and use the latest versions.  
* **Submit receipts & billables weekly** **in Quickbooks** to keep invoicing clean and the organization’s cash flow healthy.  
* **Calendar accuracy \+ sub plan** when you’ll be out of the office (owner, deputies, links, etc.).  
* **Clearly Communicate Status:** Use this format: *Here’s where we are → Here’s the gap → Here’s the next step.*  
* **ROI Guardrail applied** to all new/expanding work; pause if not met.

*This is “how we do excellence,” not bureaucracy.*

# **5\) Weekly Scrum \- Minimal Viable Ritual:**

The weekly scrum is the heartbeat of OWL’s distributed leadership model. It creates shared visibility, fast unblocking, and just-in-time decision-making so we keep our promises to partners and to one another. When we treat the scrum as a weekly operating system (not just a status meeting) we protect flow, surface risks early, and make better and more timely decisions for the organization. Reference [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_tF1v-sSqAd0sMu_ddcjletqYu4iZul7fNdT2CGW2I8/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

**Scrum Purpose from a Collective leadership Lens (what success looks like in terms of effective decision making):**

* Everyone sees the same work, the same risks, and the same priorities.  
* Blockers are named and **resolved or routed** (often via a small, time-boxed **Swarm**).  
* Decisions that affect others are **logged** in **\#decision\_log**.  
* Commitments are clear, realistic, and reflected on the Kanban.

**Minimum Scrum Expectations:**

* **Prep:** Update Productive before the meeting.  
* **Flow:** *Kanban review → KPI flash → Grants & Client Partnerships (ROI Guardrail) → Blockers/Swarm triggers → Decisions to log*  
* **Updates:** Card owners provide succinct, minimum essential updates per the *Here’s where we are → Here’s the gap → Here’s the next step* format. The focus stays on the exceptions to “Good to Go,” not a general info session.  
* **Output:** Cards moved, **\#decision\_log** entries posted, owners/dates clear.

# **6\) Performance, Growth, & Accountability — Backstop** 

**Why this section exists:** A distributed leadership model without a single Executive Director or CEO, still requires a fair, transparent, and legally sound way to address sustained performance gaps, policy breaches, or behavior that violates the open/trust-based ethos of OWL. The following Performance Backstop protocol preserves psychological safety and growth first, while also protecting our mission, finances, partners, and team. Note: This protocol is not a contract and does not alter at-will employment status.

**Guiding principles:**

* **Growth before discipline.** Coaching, clarity, and support are our default mode. We escalate only when patterns persist.  
* **One “A.”** Each stage of the Performance Backstop names exactly one Accountable role per the Decision Ladder/RACI-S format.   
* **Due process \+ confidentiality.** Throughout any stage of this process, we only use shared facts, time-boxed plans, and secure records; access is limited to those with a legitimate business/legal reason. We also only log operational impacts in the Slack \#decision\_log (2-5 lines max, no names or HR details); Personnel details live in restricted HR records managed by the DFO.

### **6.A \- Peer Partnerships & Monthly one-on-ones (proactive layer)**

This base-level arrangement provides an ongoing leadership forum to prevent small issues from becoming big ones. Its purpose is to create a regular cadence for mutual clarity, coaching, peer mentorship, and policy hygiene *before* any “backstop” stages are needed.

* **Peer Steward-of-Record (PSR).** Each OWL Director is paired with one PSR per year (re-assigned at the first monthly Strategy Session each year). The PSR is your primary check-in partner and becomes the Peer Case Steward (PCS) if a concern escalates.  
* **Monthly PSR 1:1.** Each Director completes at least one 30-min PSR 1:1 check in per month. Note that other, brief check-ins with the other Directors are encouraged, but not required.   
* **PSR framework/agenda (30 min max):**   
  1. *What moved?* (key outcomes, Bright Spots/Proof Points)  
  2. *What’s next?* (top 2–3 commitments for the next 2-4 weeks)  
  3. *Any risks?* (capacity, guardrails, compliance, relationships, etc.)  
  4. *Policy hygiene?* (receipts/invoicing, Productive, file hygiene, calendars/OOO “sub plans,” \#decision\_log, KPIs)  
* **Simple signal:** End each PSR 1:1 with a radically candid discussion of performance based on self-reflection, facts, and data. It should translate into a *Green / Yellow / Red* signal/indicator until the next PSR 1:1, with one concrete next step.

### **6.B \- Performance Backstop Triggers (the “5-R test”)**

* **Performance Backstop Triggers (using the 5-R test):** We proactively escalate into and within this Performance Backstop protocol when there is a performance pattern that clearly affects any of the following:   
  * **Reach** (others’ work is affected),   
  * **Resources** (money/time slippage),   
  * **Risk** (legal/compliance),   
  * **Reversibility** (hard to undo),   
  * **Reputation/Record** (brand, ethics, commitments). 

  While various scenarios can trigger this elevation, the PSR 1:1 is the organization’s early warning indicator. Specifically, if a Yellow signal persists for two consecutive PSR 1:1s *or* flips to Red once, the Performance Backstop steps are initiated as outlined below.

### **6.C \- Roles for Cases (no supervisors required)**

* **Peer Case Steward (PCS).** A neutral colleague (often the current PSR) chosen for proximity to the work, neutrality, and bandwidth. Leads day-to-day coaching and documentation at Stages 0–2.  
* **Review Triad.** DFO (HR/compliance), D-OSL (precedent/mission), and the PCS. This team is engaged at the tactical level (stage 1 below) to ensure fairness, provide timeline accountability, approve appropriate escalation to the next stage, and protect consistency.  
* **Records & confidentiality.** The PCS keeps transparent working notes throughout the process and the DFO maintains any confidential personnel records; Slack \#decision\_log entries are kept, but only for any applicable organizational, operational level impacts.  
* **Conflicts/recusal.** In cases where there is a conflict of interest (e.g. if the case involves the DFO or D-OSL), an alternative director will make up the Review Triad and assume the appropriate responsibilities outlined below. 

### **6.D Stages & RACI Decision Roles (PCS/Triad model)**

**Stage 0 — Gentle course-correction** *(Relational/Operational Level; 0–2 weeks)*

* **A/R:** The Peer Steward-of-Record (PSR) for the person in question automatically becomes the Peer Case Steward (PCS)  
* **C:** DFO (policy check, if needed), D-OSL (prior precedent, if needed)  
* **I:** Other directors and team members, but only for any applicable operational actions \- not for specific details.  
* **Action:** Enhanced radical-candor check-in to clarify and restate role/organizational expectations; agree on next steps; brief follow-up date.  
* **Log:** The PSR/PCS keeps private notes; only communicate applicable and sanitized operational impacts (e.g. coverage plan, timeline change, etc.) in the Slack \#decision\_log. Specific names, diagnoses, personal details, or action plans are never logged.

**Stage 1 — Documented Expectations & Support Plan** *(Operational → Tactical Level; 2–4 weeks)*

* **A/R:** PCS notifies the Review Triad to begin Stage 1 if Stage 0 actions do not show improvement (per the 5-R test).  
* **C:** **DFO** (HR/process), **D-OSL** (alignment/precedent)  
* **I:** Director team (heads-up only)  
* **Action:** One-page Expectations & Support plan that includes specific performance behaviors linked to facts/results, targeted coaching and support, and follow up expectation linked to dates. Scheduled plan check-ins by the PCS and Review Triad at least once per every two weeks.  
* **Records:** Store in confidential personnel file (DFO custodian). Log in the same manner as Stage 0\.

**Stage 2 — Formal Growth & Accountability Plan** *(Tactical → Strategic Level; 6–8 weeks)*

* **A:** **DFO** notifies the Review Triad to formally begin Stage 2 if Stage 1 actions do not show improvement (per the 5-R test); also ensures proper HR/legal posture and policy compliance through this stage.  
* **R:** **PCS** (runs the plan day-to-day)  
* **C:** **D-OSL** (precedent/mission), relevant peer Director  
* **I:** Board Chair  
* **Action:** Time-boxed Formal Growth & Accountability Plan with 3–5 measurable outcomes, supports, dates, and a mid-point review with the Review Triad.  
* **Records:** Signed plan; check-in notes stored securely by DFO. Log in the same manner as Stage 1\.

**Stage 3 — Final Warning or Role Realignment** *(Strategic)*

* **A:** **D-OSL** notifies the Review Triad to formally begin Stage 3 if Stage 2 actions do not show improvement (per the 5-R test); also ensures organizational precedent & addresses mission risk throughout this stage.  
* **R:** **DFO** (validates all HR/legal paperwork and risk checks) **\+ PCS** (appropriate handoff/coverage during this stage)  
* **C:** Board Chair; peer Directors  
* **I:** Board of Directors (communication led by the Leadership Team Officer).  
* **Action:** Either (a) Final Warning with a short and specific time window with clear, concrete actions, or (b) Role Realignment (scope change, reduced responsibilities, or time-bound probation).  
* **Log:** Signed final warning document or role realignment document; check-in notes stored securely by DFO. Log a sanitized version of operational impacts only (e.g. “temporary reassignment of X responsibilities through \<date\> to ensure delivery”).

**Stage 4 — Separation** *(Strategic / mission-critical)*

* **A (non-officer employees):** **DFO**, with **D-OSL** co-sign on precedent/mission  
* **A (Director-level/officer):** **Board Chair** per bylaws; Director team consulted  
* **R:** **DFO** (off-boarding, notices, device/access), **PCS** (handoff plan)  
* **C:** Counsel as needed; peer Directors  
* **I:** Board of Directors (communication led by the Leadership Team Officer).  
* **Action:** Dignified transition; clear date; handoff & comms plan that protects relationships and delivery.  
* **Records:** Final memo and exit checklist stored securely; adjust system access immediately.

**Note:** Any case that involves potential Code of Ethics violations (e.g. harassment, discrimination, retaliation, fraud, confidentiality breach, etc.), skips the PSR flow and involves immediate notification of the DFO and the Board Chair. Depending on severity, the case may jump directly to Stage 3 or 4\. Anti-retaliation and confidentiality apply.

### **6.E \- Additional Details**

* **Non-Negotiables:** Any case that involves potential Code of Ethics violations (e.g. harassment, discrimination, retaliation, fraud, confidentiality breach, etc.), skips the PSR flow and involves immediate notification of the DFO and the Board Chair. Depending on severity, the case may jump directly to Stage 3 or 4\. Anti-retaliation and confidentiality apply.  
* **Stage Timing:** The time windows in each stage above are minimum viable and should be shortened if the risk is acute; extend cautiously if real progress is documented.  
* **Appeals & Safeguards:** Any employee may request a facilitated conversation with the PCS or a neutral Director). If due process or fairness seems compromised, escalate to the Board Chair. OWL’s anti-retaliation policy always applies.

### **6.F \- Contingencies & Recusals (when the assigned role is the subject of the case)**

To preserve fairness and the “one-A” rule, anyone who is the subject of a performance concern is recused from their assigned role above. Use the following order of precedence to appoint alternates. Timelines and documentation standards remain the same.

**General rules:**

* **Recusal:** If a person is the subject of the case, they may not serve as PCS, Review Triad member, or “A/R” at any stage.  
* **One-A preserved:** The remaining directors will use the following substitution map as guidance, but will ensure exactly one Accountable role per stage is maintained.  
* **Records custodian:** If DFO is recused, the directors will appoint a Records Custodian to hold confidential personnel records for this case only.  
* **Board visibility:** Any notification steps that involve the Board will be led by the Leadership Team Officer (LTO).

**Substitution map:**

* **DFO is the subject →** All DFO responsibilities shift to **D-OSL**, with **DPIV** as backup.  
* **D-OSL is the subject →** All D-OSL responsibilities shift to **DPIV**, with **DFO** as backup.  
* **DPIV is the subject →** Triad remains **DFO \+ D-OSL \+** other Director (acts as PCS).  
* **Two Directors are subjects →** The Leadership Team Officer (LTO) meets with the Board Chair to create an Ad Hoc Oversight Panel (two non-subject Directors \+ one outside advisor from the Board, if needed). “A” assignments follow the stage logic but are held by a non-subject Director designated by the Panel.

### **6.G \- Cross-references**

* Reference the **Professional Growth & Development** procedure for coaching norms and feedback practices (these underpin Stages 0–2).  
* Reference the **Communication, Conflict, & Records** procedure for standards and protocols regarding confidentiality, document hygiene, and restricted personnel records.  
* Reference **OWL’s Code of Conduct & Ethics** for all non-negotiables and immediate-escalation cases.

# **Appendix 1: Collective Leadership Guiding Principles**

1. **Mission Alignment First**  
   * All decisions must directly support OWL's mission, core values, and learner-centered philosophy. This ensures that every action we take contributes to our broader purpose of educational transformation.  
   * When a proposed decision appears inconsistent with these values (a call anyone in the organization is empowered to make), it will be reviewed by the full Director team, and if necessary, elevated to the Board of Directors for final judgment.  
2. **Trust & Psychological Safety**  
   * Radical transparency (openness in communication and decision-making) and mutual respect are essential to how we work. Our “open source” culture ensures we assume good intentions, speak candidly, and share information freely and openly.  
   * Giving and receiving honest feedback, even when difficult, is a leadership responsibility. Vulnerability \- such as admitting uncertainty or asking for help \- is a strength that supports collective growth.  
3. **Clear Roles \+ Adaptive Structure \= Agility**  
   * We define [clear roles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ovVpcb9pLkq8cFQRY3TdRKGAr6_0MI8G?usp=drive_link) (not rigid titles) so that decisions can be made close to the work and without unnecessary bottlenecks. Role descriptions are based on functions, not hierarchy.  
   * These roles are reviewed and refined annually to reflect evolving team needs, capacity, and strategic direction. This keeps us nimble and adaptable.  
4. **Collective Intelligence Over Command-and-Control**  
   * We favor shared decision-making over top-down mandates. Involving multiple voices leads to more equitable, creative, and context-aware solutions.  
   * Our decision modes include:  
     * Consensus: All involved must agree before moving forward.  
     * Consent: A proposal moves forward unless someone objects with reason.  
     * Delegated Authority: A designated person or team leads the decision, often with input from others.  
5. **Feedback Loops as Fuel for Growth**  
   * We expect timely, constructive, and reciprocal feedback across all roles.  
   * We use tools such as:  
     * Radical Candor: A model of caring personally while challenging directly.  
     * Peer Debriefs: Short reflections after projects or events to share insights and improvements.  
     * Retrospectives: Periodic team check-ins to assess what worked, what didn’t, and what to change.  
6. **Learning Organization Ethos**  
   * As a learning organization, we embrace experimentation, iteration, and co-creation. Failure is always reframed as a data point for improvement.  
   * We use:  
     * Design Thinking and Improvement Science: Human-centered processes for solving problems and continuous improvement through empathy, ideation, prototyping, testing, and refining per data-informed decisions.  
     * Lean Startup Principles: Launching small, low-risk pilots (Minimum Viable Products or "MVPs") to test ideas and improve based on real-world feedback.  
7. **Autonomy with Accountability**  
   * Everyone at OWL is trusted to lead from their role. We expect initiative and encourage individual ownership.  
   * Autonomy is supported by:  
     * OKRs (Objectives and Key Results): A goal-setting framework that aligns individual objectives with team and org-wide goals.  
     * Clear expectations, shared dashboards, and transparent follow-through.  
8. **Shared Decision-Making in Ambiguity**  
   * Not all decisions fall neatly within one functional area or role. In these cases of ambiguity, OWL Directors are expected to:  
* Proactively initiate collaborative discussions.  
* Identify the appropriate lead and support roles using RACI or consent-based co-design.  
* Focus on achieving alignment and shared responsibility \- not enforcing silos. The emphasis remains on clarity, accountability, and alignment with OWL’s mission, rather than positional authority.  
9. **Conflict Resolution Process**  
   * When disagreement or confusion arises within the collective leadership team:  
     * Address concerns directly with the impacted peer(s) first.  
     * If unresolved, bring the issue to the full Director team during the next scheduled OWL scrum.  
     * If consensus cannot be reached, the issue is escalated to the Board Chair for facilitation, mediation, or formal vote.

# **Appendix 2: OWL’s Decision Types & Methods (Aligned to the Decision Ladder)**

**How to use:** Pick the **type/level**, apply the **primary method**, ensure **exactly one “A”** in RACI-S, and post to **\#decision\_log** when the decision affects others’ plans, money, timelines, promises, or risk.

| Decision Type (Ladder Level) | Characteristics | Typical Examples | Primary Method | RACI-S Notes | Log? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Operational (Team-Level)** | Low risk, time-sensitive, localized impact; easily reversible | Agenda tweaks, room setup, minor invoice timing, swapping a facilitation activity | **Delegated Authority** | Owner is **A**; consult only if another person’s plan is affected | Log **only if** it changes someone else’s plan/money/timeline/risk |
| **Tactical (Cross-Lane Impact)** | Medium impact within or across portfolios; touches budget, capacity, scope, or partner expectations | Shift workshop dates, reassign PM capacity, within-guardrail scope change, modest travel above plan | **Consent** after targeted consults | **One A**; identify **C** roles early; add **S** if co-build needed | **Yes** — post concise entry with Decision Ladder tag |
| **Strategic (Org-Level / Multi-Year / Brand)** | High impact; affects systems, pricing/ROI, partnerships, multi-year grants, public commitments | New partnership/MOU, pricing exceptions, major public campaign, large grant submission | **Consent** with director team; escalate per governance | **One A**; Board **I** (or **C**) when material; link to artifacts | **Yes** — always |
| **Mission-Critical (Future, Brand, or Structure)** | Organization- defining; affects solvency, mission/vision, leadership, or legal posture | Annual budget adoption, leadership restructuring, mission/ vision revision | **Board Review/ Approval** (per bylaws) | **One A** internally; Board role specified; legal/ compliance **C** | **Yes** — include approvals and effective dates |
| **Ambiguous / Shared (Sensemaking Needed)** | Doesn’t fall cleanly in one lane; requires co-design to clarify ownership and risk | New cross-functional tool, equity-focused expansion, novel edge cases | **Co-design \+ Consent** using RACI-S | Clarify **one A** before finalizing; use **S** for shared build | **Yes** — link to the chosen pattern in “Appendix 4 Scenarios” |

**Best-practice notes to the above (applies to all types of decisions):**

* One A, always. Collaboration ≠ multiple “owners.” Use RACI-S (along with respective Roles & Responsibility documents) to keep roles crisp.  
* Make nimble decisions at the lowest responsible level. Escalate only when the 5-R test hits: Reach, Resources, Risk, Reversibility (one-way door), Reputation/Record.  
* Keep it lightweight. A good \#decision\_log entry is 3–5 lines (summary, RACI-S, why it matters, next step, link).  
* If in doubt, log. Short \+ clear beats invisible \+ assumed.  
* For complex/cross-team items, reference a matching pattern in Appendix 4: Example Scenarios Using RACI-S and link them together.

# **Appendix 3: Clarifying Strategic vs. Tactical Roles (Directors ↔ PMs)**

Most Directors also serve as Program Managers for a region/portfolio. Expectations:

* Own the full lifecycle of each respective client-facing contract (scope → delivery → reflection → renewal) by maintaining direct relationships, and guaranteeing consistent, high-quality delivery of service and support. Tell stories of impact with artifacts (Bright Spots/Proof Points).  
* A good rule of thumb to balance one’s PM role with one’s organizational role is client-facing service for 2–3 days/wk, org stewardship for 1–2 days/wk, and regional growth on at least a weekly basis (as capacity allows).  
* Use shared systems consistently; ask for help early; step in when peers need support.

*This is how we stay learner-centered, financially healthy, and trusted in the field.*

## **Strategic vs. Tactical Responsibility Map**

| Decision Area | Director – Strategic Responsibility (Org Level) | PM – Tactical Responsibility (Region/Contract Level) | Other Directors – As-Needed Support |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Budget & Financial Oversight** | **DFO:** set annual budget strategy, pricing guardrails, overhead model; board reporting; cash discipline. | Track contract budget-to-actuals; submit time/expenses/ receipts; request scope/budget changes; ensure full utilization. | **D-OSL:** align to strategy; **DPIV:** delivery tradeoffs. |

## **Escalation Triggers (when PMs should pull in Directors)**

Log a decision and escalate to the Director “A” when **any** of these occur:

* **Budget/Risk:** overages \>10%, change to payment terms, indemnity/insurance questions, or compliance gaps.  
* **Scope/Capacity:** changes to deliverables, timeline, staffing assignments, or multi-site implications.  
* **Brand/Comms:** press, public statements, co-branding, or sensitive messaging.  
* **Partnerships/Grants:** new MOU, co-fundraising, or funder-driven scope requirements.  
* **Tooling/Process:** adoption affecting multiple teams or financial/reporting flows.

## **Examples (apply the table above)**

* **Regional grant led by a PM: A:** D-OSL (strategy/approval**)** · **R:** PM (draft/submission) · **C:** DFO (budget), DPIV (metrics), D-OSL (fit) · **Notes:** If staffing or match shifts, log **Scope/Capacity** \+ **Budget**; post link \+ budget v\# in **\#decision\_log**.

* **Contract scope change mid-delivery: A:** PM (within guardrails) · **R:** PM · **C:** DFO (terms), DPIV (program impact) · **Notes:** If ROI guardrail or precedent is impacted, elevate to **Strategic** with D-OSL; update contract & Productive; log outcome.

**Important:** Directors **own the system**; PMs **own the site-level contracts**. Shared success \= using the same playbook with clear decision rights and fast, visible follow-through.

# **Appendix 4: Example Scenarios Using RACI-S**

The following examples illustrate how OWL’s collective leadership model uses the RACI-S framework in real-world decisions. These examples are far from an exhaustive list of the kinds of decisions OWL will face, but they do provide an internal reference point to support the kind of shared understanding and reinforcement of the importance of clarity, transparency, and collaboration in our work so that we successfully leverage OWL’s distributed leadership model in order to better meet the needs of our stakeholders.

**When to use this.** If a decision crosses lanes and you’re unsure how to assign roles, use the scenarios below as patterns. Always ensure there is exactly one “A” (Accountable); tag the Decision Ladder level (Operational / Tactical / Strategic) and post to the Slack \#decision\_log.

## **Scenario 1 — New Grant Proposal (programmatic; due in 4 weeks)**

* **Level:** Strategic (funding \+ public commitment)  
* **A:** **D-OSL**  
* **R:** PM (narrative \+ submission)  
* **C:** **DFO** (budget/compliance), **DPIV** (impact story/data), **D-OSL** (strategic fit)  
* **I:** Team (Board if material)  
* **S:** **DFO** (attachments/packaging)

**Notes:** If staffing, scope, or match assumptions change, log linked **Scope/Capacity** and **Budget** decisions; coordinate funder stewardship with **D-OSL**; after submission, post the grant link, budget version, and a RACI-S snapshot in **\#decision\_log** and pin in the project thread.

## **Scenario 2 — Strategic Partnership with Another Nonprofit (MOU, roles, boundaries)**

* **Level:** Strategic (brand, revenue, scope, long-term commitments)  
* **A:** **D-OSL**  
* **R:** PM (partner vetting, term sheet/MOU drafting, internal alignment)  
* **C:** **D-OSL** (mission/strategy fit, governance), **DFO** (budget, risk, compliance, data/privacy), **DPIV** (program alignment, visibility/branding), **PM(s)** (delivery feasibility)

* **S:** **DFO** (MOU language, insurance/indemnity, data-sharing terms), **DPIV** (storytelling/brand assets), **PM(s)** (pilot scoping)

**Notes:** If the partnership changes delivery promises, budget exposure, or staffing, log linked **Scope/Capacity** and **Budget** decisions; if co-fundraising is involved, log a **Grant/Donor Coordination** decision (lead, calendar, stewardship); after execution, post the final MOU link and a RACI-S snapshot in **\#decision\_log** and pin in the shared channel.

* **I:** Team  
* **S:** **DPIV** (mentoring/shadowing plan)

**Notes:** If role affects partner delivery or replaces staff capacity, log a **Scope/Capacity** decision; schedule and log the **60-day check-in** (PM owner) with a short performance note; post the executed agreement link and access checklist in **\#decision\_log**.

## **Scenario 5 — Compliance Gap (e.g., expired contractor agreement discovered)**

* **I:** Team; Board informed via liaison when material  
* **S:** **DFO** (channel scheduling, web updates, asset management)

**Notes:** If announcing dates/deliverables, log a linked **Scope/Timeline** decision; attach the message map and calendar to the decision post; after launch, post a brief **impact readout** (reach, engagement, next step).

* **A:** **D-OSL**  
* **R:** **DFO** (roll-out, permissions, SOP updates)  
* **C:** **DPIV**, **PMs** (workflow impacts)  
* **I:** Team  
* **S:** **DFO** (training materials, migrations)

**Notes:** Time-box a **pilot** with success criteria; log **Adopt/Decline** with a 3-bullet retro; if adoption changes how we track financials or delivery, log linked **KPI/Reporting** updates.

## **Scenario 8 — Innovation Sprint (prototype a new service model)**

* **Level:** Tactical → Strategic (if external pilots/positioning)

* **C:** **DFO** (partner/funder interest), **PMs** (field feasibility)  
* **I:** Team (Board optional if strategy-impacting)  
* **S:** **DFO** (logistics), **DPIV** (storytelling/funder briefs)

**Notes:** Define **Bright Spots/Proof Points** and data capture up front; if external piloting or pricing is proposed, log linked **Go/No-Go** and **Pricing/ROI** decisions; post a short **learning summary** with next-step owners.

## **Scenario 9 — Conference Proposal (national audience; co-presenters)**

* **Level:** Tactical

* **C:** **DFO** (travel/fees), **D-OSL** (alignment with pipeline)  
* **I:** Team  
* **S:** **DFO** (registration & logistics), **DPIV** (promo assets)

**Notes:** If accepted, log **Travel & Delivery Plan** (budget, staffing, materials); after delivery, post slides/recording links and a **two-bullet debrief** (reach \+ lead-ins).

## **Scenario 10 — Multi-Year Renewal / Expansion with a District**

* **Level:** Strategic (revenue \+ capacity)  
* **A:** **DPIV** (or **PM** of record if designated)  
* **R:** DPIV/PM (re-scope & delivery plan), **DFO** (pricing, payment schedule)  
* **C:** **D-OSL** (pipeline/terms, strategic fit/precedent)  
* **I:** Team; Board informed if material  
* **S:** **DFO** (contract update, calendars/CRM)
