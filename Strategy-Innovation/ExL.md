{% hint style="info" %}
**Owner:** Director of Orgazational Strategy & Learning (DOSL) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff, partners, and stakeholders
{% endhint %}

## Purpose
OWL believes that Experiential learning (ExL) is not a new program for educators to add to their already crowded plates. It is a way of designing the foundational culture of a school so that students learn *through* meaningful experience \- i.e. investigating real questions, wrestling with open-ended problems, and creating work that matters beyond the gradebook. When students have repeated opportunities to experience, reflect, make meaning, and apply their ideas, they develop the habits of mind and heart needed for a complex, rapidly changing world. These include, but are not limited to agency, collaboration, persistence, problem solving, critical thinking, agility and adaptability, and a strong sense of purpose. The [OWL Experiential Learning Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12v1Xnc22Z3WRI-9DGxuBDbEayVxb-ov-ydEMm3ndQTg/edit?usp=sharing) names this as a framework for learner-centered innovation and outlines ten core principles and is organized into mindsets like Purposeful Rigor & Growth, Authenticity & Relevance, Navigation Tools, and Learning Process, etc. that can anchor this culture shift in any school or district.

This position statement sits alongside the above Playbook as a deeper dive into those ten principles and is based on years of experience OWL has had supporting schools and districts make this shift happen. For each Experiential Learning element, such as public products, student agency, sustained inquiry, or continuous feedback and iteration, it offers concrete examples across a range of approaches: project- and problem-based learning, place- and service-based learning, profession-based pathways, studio and design-based work, challenge- and game-based learning, and more. Together, the Playbook and this paper give educators a shared language and a practical map that makes meaning for the ideas related to Experiential Learning. Specifically, the Playbook shows the overall terrain and the “why,” while this position statement highlights specific design moves teachers and school teams can use to bring high-quality ExL to life in their own context.

1. ### [**Purposeful Rigor & Growth for All Students**](https://www.responsiveclassroom.org/challenge-is-a-part-of-learning/)

   *Experiential learning requires students to engage in deep thinking, apply complex concepts, and persist through challenges, fostering intellectual growth and resilience.*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **PBL & PrBL:** In math-based STEM projects, students must apply algebra and trigonometry to design and optimize structures (e.g., a bridge model with material constraints).  
* **Challenge-Based Learning:** Tackling climate change solutions requires interdisciplinary problem-solving and analysis of statistical models.  
* **Case-Based Learning:** Analyzing a real-world economic recession demands data interpretation and financial modeling skills.

2. ### [**Authenticity & Relevance**](https://www.edutopia.org/article/increasing-authenticity-classroom/)

    *Students engage more deeply when learning is connected to their lives, communities, and the real world. Authenticity fosters intrinsic motivation and long-term retention.*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **Place-Based Learning:** Using local demographic data to analyze community growth rates makes math meaningful and personal.  
* **Service-Based Learning:** Applying statistics and probability to help a food bank optimize distribution strategies.  
* **STEM/Maker-Based Learning:** Designing robotic solutions for accessibility challenges in the school environment.

3. ### [**Public Products/Exhibitions**](https://shareyourlearning.org/)

   *Students perform better when their work has an authentic audience beyond the teacher. Public products foster accountability, deeper learning, and pride in accomplishment.*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **Studio-Based Learning:** Students create and showcase data visualizations of economic inequality to present at a community forum.  
* **Design-Based Learning:** Engineering 3D-printed prosthetic hands, tested in collaboration with medical professionals.  
* **Game-Based Learning:** Coding an interactive game that teaches algebra concepts, which younger students play and provide feedback on.


4. ### [**Activities Connected to Key Knowledge & Skills (Standards, Learning Targets, etc.)**](https://spencerauthor.com/standards-and-pbl/)

   *Experiential learning isn’t "anything goes"—it must be rigorous and tied to essential knowledge (Common Core, Next Gen Science, etc.), otherwise it’s “hands on, minds off.”*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **Inquiry-Based Learning:** A project on exponential growth connects math, science, and financial literacy.  
* **Phenomenon-Based Learning:** A study of hurricanes and weather patterns integrates data modeling and probability.  
* **Proficiency-Based Learning:** Students progress through math modules at their own pace, ensuring mastery before moving forward.

5. ### [**Sustained Inquiry**](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2017/10/18/combining-inquiry-and-pbl-3-guidelines-for-success/) **(Student-Generated Questions)**

   *Experiential learning prioritizes curiosity over rote learning. Inquiry deepens understanding and promotes self-directed learning.*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **IBL & PrBL:** Students ask, "How does AI detect fraud?", leading to an exploration of patterns, probability, and machine learning.  
* **Community-Based Learning:** "What factors lead to local traffic congestion?", prompting analysis of traffic data, rates, and ratios.  
* **Challenge-Based Learning:** "How can we reduce energy waste in our school?", requiring real-world data collection and modeling.

6. ### [**Culture of Collaboration**](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2018/10/11/collaboration-bringing-students-together-to-promote-learning-can-move/)

   *Collaboration reflects real-world teamwork and teaches students how to negotiate, communicate, and build on ideas.*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **PBL & Work-Based Learning:** Students collaborate with engineers to design sustainable building materials.  
* **Service-Based Learning:** Groups analyze financial literacy data and teach younger students about budgeting.  
* **Maker-Based Learning:** Teams code and build robots that can navigate mazes using trigonometry-based algorithms and challenges.

7. ### [**Managing the Process**](https://spencerauthor.com/project-management/) **(Time, Resources, Conflict, etc.)**

   *Experiential learning demands organization, leadership, and project management, mirroring real-life professional environments.*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **Case-Based Learning:** Students manage long-term math research projects, dividing tasks and timelines.  
* **Profession/Work-Based Learning:** Internships require self-management and accountability.  
* **Design-Based Learning:** Teams handle budgets, materials, and iterative prototyping cycles.

8. ### [**Reflection of the Learning**](https://www.edutopia.org/article/treating-reflection-habit-not-event/)

   *Reflection solidifies learning, enhances metacognition, and helps students understand how they learn best. As John Dewey said, “We don’t learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience.”*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **Game-Based Learning:** After designing a digital math escape room, students reflect on problem-solving strategies.  
* **Inquiry-Based Learning:** Students keep math journals, recording their evolving understanding of concepts.  
* **Spaced Practice in PBL:** Weekly reflections track improvements in statistical analysis projects.

9. ### [**Student Agency**](https://www.rti.org/insights/the-power-of-student-agency-and-choice) **(Voice & Choice)**

   *Ownership of learning increases motivation, creativity, and self-efficacy.*  
   🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **Passion-Based Learning:** Students pick a topic of interest and design a math investigation project.  
* **IBL & Design-Based Learning:** Students choose which climate change models to analyze and simulate.  
* **Proficiency-Based Learning:** Students self-pace through adaptive algebra modules.

10. ### [**Continuous Feedback & Iteration**](https://www.pblworks.org/blog/gold-standard-pbl-critique-and-revision)

    *Iteration is key to deep understanding—students continually improve their work and learning through feedback and revision.*  
    🔹 **Example Applications:**  
* **Studio-Based Learning:** Iterating on bridge designs based on force calculations.  
* **Design-Based Learning:** Refining coding projects after user testing.  
* **Maker-Based Learning:** Testing robotic movement algorithms, improving with each iteration.
