# OWL's Approach to Collective Leadership and Decision Making

Open Way Learning embraces a collective leadership model that intentionally departs from the traditional hierarchical structures common in most organizations—including schools. Inspired by the philosophies in *The Open Organization* by Jim Whitehurst, *Drive* by Daniel Pink, and *Open Up, Education\!* by Ben Owens and Adam Haigler, OWL's approach is rooted in the belief that leadership is not confined to titles or positions, but is distributed, transparent, and purpose-aligned.

OWL's decision-making practices are grounded in five core principles:

* Transparency and open-source values — sharing knowledge openly to foster trust and accountability.  
* Purpose-driven work — ensuring every decision and role aligns with our mission and impact goals.  
* Distributed authority — empowering decisions to be made where the knowledge and insight are closest to the work.  
* Agile, iterative processes — promoting learning, adaptation, and continuous improvement.  
* Psychological safety — cultivating a culture of trust, candor, and innovation.

This document is a living framework designed to support OWL's culture of collaborative leadership and agile decision-making. Whether you're selecting a new vendor or co-designing a major initiative, you don't need permission to lead a decision, but you do need clarity, communication, and alignment with our shared process. What follows is the guidance to ensure those elements are always in place.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Mission Alignment First**  
   * All decisions must directly support OWL's mission, core values, and learner-centered philosophy. This ensures that every action we take contributes to our broader purpose of educational transformation.  
   * When a proposed decision appears inconsistent with these values (a call anyone in the organization is empowered to make), it will be reviewed by the full Director team, and if necessary, elevated to the Board of Directors for final judgment.  
2. **Trust & Psychological Safety**  
   * Radical transparency (openness in communication and decision-making) and mutual respect are essential to how we work. Our “open source” culture ensures we assume good intentions, speak candidly, and share information freely and openly.  
   * Giving and receiving honest feedback, even when difficult, is a leadership responsibility. Vulnerability—such as admitting uncertainty or asking for help—is a strength that supports collective growth.  
3. **Clear Roles \+ Adaptive Structure \= Agility**  
   * We define [clear roles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ovVpcb9pLkq8cFQRY3TdRKGAr6_0MI8G?usp=drive_link) (not rigid titles) so that decisions can be made close to the work and without unnecessary bottlenecks. Role descriptions are based on functions, not hierarchy.  
   * These roles are reviewed and refined annually to reflect evolving team needs, capacity, and strategic direction. This keeps us nimble and adaptable.  
4. **Collective Intelligence Over Command-and-Control**  
   * We favor shared decision-making over top-down mandates. Involving multiple voices leads to more equitable, creative, and context-aware solutions.  
   * Our decision modes include:  
     * Consensus: All involved must agree before moving forward.  
     * Consent: A proposal moves forward unless someone objects with reason.  
     * Delegated Authority: A designated person or team leads the decision, often with input from others.  
5. **Feedback Loops as Fuel for Growth**  
   * We expect timely, constructive, and reciprocal feedback across all roles.  
   * We use tools such as:  
     * Radical Candor: A model of caring personally while challenging directly.  
     * Peer Debriefs: Short reflections after projects or events to share insights and improvements.  
     * Retrospectives: Periodic team check-ins to assess what worked, what didn't, and what to change.  
6. **Learning Organization Ethos**  
   * As a learning organization, we embrace experimentation, iteration, and co-creation.  
   * We use:  
     * Design Thinking: A human-centered process for solving problems through empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing.  
     * Lean Startup Principles: Launching small, low-risk pilots (Minimum Viable Products or "MVPs") to test ideas and improve based on real-world feedback.  
   * Failure is reframed as data for improvement.  
7. **Autonomy with Accountability**  
   * Everyone at OWL is trusted to lead from their role. We expect initiative and encourage individual ownership.  
   * Autonomy is supported by:  
     * OKRs (Objectives and Key Results): A goal-setting framework that aligns individual objectives with team and org-wide goals.  
     * Clear expectations, shared dashboards, and transparent follow-through.

## OWL's Decision-Making Framework

OWL's decision-making framework is grounded in values of trust, transparency, shared ownership, and adaptability. It helps ensure clarity and effectiveness in how we make decisions \- big or small \- within our collective leadership model and includes 3 phases that embed the following relevant tools and protocols: 

* The RACI model (for role clarity)  
* A decision type ladder (to scale complexity)  
* A 7-step shared decision process (to ensure alignment)  
* Agile tools and protocols to ensure consistency  
* A Slack Decision Log (for transparency and institutional learning)

### Phase 1: Frame the decision to understand its context, urgency, and scope

1. #### **Clearly define and communicate the opportunity or problem related to the decision that's needed. Ask the following questions:**

   * What is the precise opportunity, challenge, or choice to be made?  
   * Why does it matter in the short and long term to OWL?  
   * What are the time, budget, staffing, or compliance limits?  
     * Think about budgets, staff availability, organizational capacity, etc.  
     * Link to strategic priorities or contract obligations if relevant.  
   * What are the decisions's implications (use a [Design Brief](https://www.nuclino.com/articles/design-brief), if helpful)?

2. #### **Based on the above, identify the decision type by using the following Decision Ladder to determine the level of structure and collaboration required:**

| Decision Type | Characteristics | Examples | Primary Method |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Operational/Everyday** | Low risk, time-sensitive, low org-wide impact | Scheduling, logistics, invoicing | [Delegated Authority](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/delegation-of-authority) |
| **Tactical, but Role-Specific** | Low to medium impact within one person's scope, may affect others | Bringing on a new Fellow, client onboarding, vendor selection | Follow the RACI process (e.g. input from Consulted) |
| **Strategic/Cross-Team** | Medium to high impact, spans teams or systems | New multi-year initiative, major partnership, hiring a new Director | Co-design: Strive for [consensus](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus#:~:text=Consensus%20decision%20making%20is%20a,at%20least%20can%20live%20with.) (backstop \= majority vote) |
| **Mission-Critical** | Major impact on OWL's future, brand, or structure | Budget adoption, leadership restructuring,  vision/mission revision | Board Review and/or Approval |
| **Ambiguous/Shared** | Doesn't fall cleanly into a role or area \- requires team  sensemaking | New software platform, cross-functional tool adoption | Meet the spirit & intent of the RACI: Co-design \+ [Consent](https://jurriaankamer.medium.com/make-better-decisions-using-consent-not-consensus-f3d459626d48) |

### Phase 2: Design and decide by engaging the right people, exploring options, and finalizing a collaborative decision

1. **Clarify roles using the OWL RACI Model (reference Appendix 1\)**

  * **Responsible (R)**: The person(s) who *does the work* to complete the task or make the decision.  
  * **Accountable (A)**: The person who is *ultimately answerable* for the decision or task; there must be only one A per decision to ensure clarity.  
  * **Consulted (C)**: Those whose *input is sought* before a decision is finalized; usually subject-matter experts or stakeholders.  
  * **Informed (I)**: Those who must be *kept up to date* on progress or outcomes after the decision is made.  
  Note that in many cases, OWL's RACI tool also includes “S” as a fifth role describing the **Support** role for individuals who actively *contribute* to the execution or design, but are not accountable for outcomes. This reflects our co-design ethos and shared implementation model (reference [What does RACI mean? \- Lean Six Sigma Group](https://leansixsigmagroep.nl/en/lean-agile-and-six-sigma/raci/)).  
2. **Engage diverse perspectives**
  * Per decision type and appropriate RACI roles, engage people affected by or who will be part of the decision process (primary users, stakeholders, etc.)  
  * Do appropriate level of collaboration and co-design review to leverage collective intelligence, from informal check-in meetings, surveys, [1-2-4-All](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/), async Slack input, etc. to ensure equity and diverse perspectives.

3. **Co-design and evaluate solutions**
  * Based on co-designed perspectives, generate, refine, and compare possible approaches (brainstorming, [Ecocycle Planning](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/31-ecocycle-planning/#:~:text=Including%20and%20Unleashing%20Everyone,development%20in%20the%20planning%20process.), [Troika method](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/8-troika-consulting/), etc.)  
  * Avoid surprises and misalignment by considering risks, equity, and feasibility in order to prioritize possible decision options ([Pros/Cons Grid](https://li.wsu.edu/documents/2018/01/student-engagement-strategies-pro-and-con-grid.pdf/), [Impact/Risk Matrix](https://projectmanagementacademy.net/resources/blog/risk-matrix/), [Importance/ Feasibility/ Viability,](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/desirability-feasibility-viability-successful-data-science-dods-phd/) etc.

4. **Make the decision and document it**
  * Use an agreed method, informed by the RACI and Decision Ladder: consensus, consent, or delegated authority.  
  * Log the decision in Slack (\#decision\_log channel \- Maintained by Manager of Finance, HR, & Communications)

### Phase 3: Follow through to ensure clarity, learning, and accountability after the decision

1. **Communicate outcomes:** Notify relevant team members (especially those marked as “I” in RACI).
2. **Implement and track:** Tie outcomes to [Objectives & Key Results](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example#:~:text=%E2%80%9COKR%E2%80%9D%20stands%20for%20Objectives%20and,set%20and%20enact%20their%20strategies.) for you, your team, or your area of responsibility (including applicable project trackers in Productive).
3. **Reflect and improve:** Use [Reflective Conversation Protocol](https://www.clee.org/resources/reflective-conversation-protocol/), [Post-Mortem Notes](https://asana.com/resources/project-post-mortem-tips), [Root Cause Failure Analysis](https://asq.org/quality-resources/root-cause-analysis?srsltid=AfmBOorsmVgDkikRvEWAXsNj_FuqOwbaEJ8TvWz2bldO84MWNrUbuL6z), [Why Tree](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/knowledge/root-cause-analysis/how-to-use-five-whys-tree-diagram/), or other forms of debrief to build collective capacity, avoid repeated mistakes, and continually improve. 

## Sustaining Collective Leadership at OWL

### Collective Leadership Responsibilities

To maintain OWL's collective leadership ethos in practice, all Directors are expected to:

* Engage in weekly scrum meetings to raise, track, and resolve decisions.  
* Share ownership for internal systems, partner-facing work, and org-wide strategy.  
* Use shared platforms (Slack, Productive, GitBooks, Google Drive) to increase visibility and track accountability.  
* Maintain alignment between program delivery, systems infrastructure, partner success, and financial sustainability.

Note that the Manager of Finance, HR & Communications, although not a Director, plays a foundational enabling role in OWL's leadership system. This role ensures operational consistency, maintains internal systems, and bridges strategy and execution across the organization. Key responsibilities include:

* Overseeing logistics, systems upkeep, invoicing, compliance, and internal operations.  
* Maintaining the central decision log and contract calendar.  
* Ensuring daily accountability and operational consistency across Director workflows.

### Shared Decision-Making in Ambiguity

Not all decisions fall neatly within one functional area or role. In these cases of ambiguity, OWL Directors are expected to:

* Proactively initiate collaborative discussions.  
* Identify the appropriate lead and support roles using RACI or consent-based co-design.  
* Focus on achieving alignment and shared responsibility—not enforcing silos.

The emphasis remains on clarity, accountability, and alignment with OWL's mission, rather than positional authority.

### Conflict Resolution Process

When disagreement or confusion arises within the collective leadership team:

1. Address concerns directly with the impacted peer(s) first.  
2. If unresolved, bring the issue to the full Director team during the next scheduled OWL scrum.  
3. If consensus cannot be reached, the issue is escalated to the Board Chair for facilitation, mediation, or formal vote.

### Culture Commitments

OWL will continually model and improve collective leadership practices internally and externally. All team members commit to:

* Transparent workflows — Avoid knowledge hoarding or opaque processes.  
* Open feedback loops — Share ideas, concerns, and improvements regularly and constructively.  
* Collective capacity over personal silos — Always act in ways that support the success of others.

To reinforce these values, OWL maintains the following systems of operational excellence:

* Meeting Protocols: All meetings must include clear agendas, time management, and follow-up documentation.  
* Roles & Responsibilities: Reviewed annually and adapted to evolving needs.  
* Strategic Planning & Risk Reviews: Conducted annually to align direction and prepare for change.  
* KPI Dashboards: Used to monitor organizational health, contract performance, and team capacity.  
* Communication Tools:  
  * Use Slack for decision threads and day-to-day updates.  
  * Use Productive for tracking accountability within projects.  
  * Use GitBook for centralized access to SOPs and resources.  
* Policy Compliance: All employees must follow the expectations and standards outlined in the Employee Handbook.

## Appendix 1: The OWL RACI Chart

This chart reflects core decision areas for OWL Directors, Managers, employees, and the Board. In some cases where tactical execution is involved (e.g. compliance tracking, communications logistics), the Manager of Finance, HR & Communications may play a key support or responsible role that is further clarified in Appendix 3\.

D\&R \= Director of Development & Research; O\&F \= Director of Operations & Finance; O\&P \= Director of Outreach & Programming; S & I \= Director of Strategy & Innovation; MAN \= Manager of Finance, HR, & Communications; OWL \= All other OWL employees; and BOD \= Board of Directors.

## Appendix 2: RACI-S Chart for Cross-Functional or Shared Decisions

Many decisions at OWL involve collaboration across multiple roles and do not fall cleanly into a single functional area as described in the above chart. In such cases, leadership and accountability may be distributed, and a single point of ownership may not be appropriate.

The following adapted RACI chart introduces a Support (S) role to reflect co-design, facilitation, and shared execution, providing clarity in situations where decisions require input and action from multiple Directors or teams. It is especially useful for ambiguous, cross-department, or equity-focused decisions that require collaboration rather than siloed ownership. 

Use this chart to identify when shared leadership applies and how to assign roles accordingly. Note: Where needed, distinctions between strategic leadership and tactical execution \- especially between Directors and the Manager \- are clarified in Appendix 3

| Decision Area | D & R | O & F | O & P | S & I | MAN | OWL | BOD |

\*This includes proactive follow-up with existing clients, identification of future engagement opportunities, and ensuring alignment with OWL values in ongoing partnerships. It also includes flagging shifts in client satisfaction and initiating conversations about contract renewals or extensions.

## Appendix 3: Clarifying Strategic vs. Tactical Roles in Collective Leadership

In OWL's distributed leadership model, certain decision areas involve both strategic direction-setting (typically Director-led) and tactical implementation (often Manager-led). To avoid confusion and reinforce clarity, this appendix outlines where and how these responsibilities diverge in common decision areas. This helps ensure that decision-making and execution reflect both long-term vision and operational excellence—while maintaining shared ownership, transparency, and accountability.

| Decision Area | Strategic Responsibility (Director) | Tactical Responsibility (Manager) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Budget & Financial Oversight** | Leads budget strategy, financial planning, and Board-level review. | Maintains budget systems, generates reports, manages day-to-day finances. |
| **Grant Applications** | Aligns proposal strategy with mission, drafts narratives, engages funders. | Prepares materials, manages timelines, and coordinates submission logistics. |
| **HR Policy & Practice** | Designs and approves policy changes aligned to org values. | Ensures compliance, documentation, and policy implementation. |
| **Operations & Internal Systems** | Sets systems strategy, selects platforms, designs workflows. | Manages tools, maintains documentation, and ensures daily operations. |
| **Compliance & Risk Management** | Oversees risk strategy, coordinates Board-level mitigation planning. | Tracks compliance deadlines, supports audits, maintains records. |
| **Communications & Brand Strategy** | Crafts comms strategy, defines messaging, aligns external voice. | Formats, schedules, and distributes content across platforms. |
| **Evaluation & Learning Systems** | Leads learning strategy, defines metrics, analyzes impact. | Supports survey distribution, dashboard updates, and data collection. |

For any scenario not clearly defined above, refer to the shared decision-making framework or consult the full Director team.

## Appendix 4: Example Scenarios Using RACI

The following examples illustrate how OWL's collective leadership model uses the RACI framework in real-world decisions. These examples are far from an exhaustive list of the kinds of decisions OWL will face, but they do provide an internal reference point to support the kind of shared understanding and reinforcement of the importance of clarity, transparency, and collaboration in our work so that we successfully leverage OWL's distributed leadership model in order to better meet the needs of our stakeholders.
