# WNC Resilience Project Playbook

**Owner:** Director of Program Impact & Visibility (DPIV) – with input from other project stakeholders
**Audience:** All current and potential participants in the [WNC Resilience Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ucJ9Ae-9tEIEoyEBneBzCHWiX_b_gAS5pmlw1c930V8/edit?usp=sharing).

# ***Project Playbook (Overview)***

### **Purpose**

The WNC Resilience Project Playbook is organized into five flexible modules, each with a distinct purpose and set of outputs. These modules build upon each other and help your team co-create a customized, iterative Innovation Blueprint grounded in student experience and continuous improvement.

| Where This Document Fits in the Process The WNC Resilience Project provides a set of connected tools to support clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Each module is part of a larger framework that helps your team move from inspiration to implementation—at a pace that fits your local context. The core tools include: Exploration & Planning Guide – Helps teams consider whether and how to engage as an innovation partner, identify early priorities, and set up for success. Onboarding Checklist – Supports initial team setup and logistics, bridging early planning to active collaboration. Playbook Modules – A set of structured but flexible guides that help teams explore, plan, test, and refine improvement strategies. Innovation Blueprint – A living document your team creates and updates throughout the project. It captures your AIM, Change Ideas, measures, and key learning. Each above tool supports a different part of the journey. The Playbook provides structure; the Blueprint captures your evolving work, etc.. OWL and its partners are here to support you every step of the way\! |

### **Module 0: Noticing the Current State (Optional Pre-Work)**

* Reflect on early student-centered observations, quotes, or data  
* Begin surfacing patterns that may point to a meaningful challenge  
* Gather artifacts and lived experience to inform empathy work  
  ✅ **Core Output**: Pre-work insights to bring into onboarding  
  📂 Suggested Tools: Student quotes, empathy interviews, early data trends

### **Module 1: Drafting a Shared Aim (Onboarding Session)**

* Create Student Empathy Maps  
* Synthesize insights through an Insight Carousel  
* Draft an AIM Statement that reflects meaningful student-centered outcomes  
* Generate and cluster Change Ideas  
* Begin sketching a Driver Diagram prototype  
  ✅ **Core Output**: Draft AIM \+ Initial Change Ideas \+ Empathy Summary  
  📂 Suggested Tools: Empathy Map Template, Insight Carousel Protocol, AIM Litmus Test

### **Module 2: Validating the Current State (Post-Onboarding)**

* Confirm the “Current State” with additional student, staff, or stakeholder input  
* Refine the Problem Statement (and optionally a “How Might We” design question)  
* Revisit and strengthen the AIM Statement based on what is learned

  ✅ **Core Output**: Validated Problem Statement \+ Refined AIM  
  📂 Suggested Tools: Student Voice Protocols, Problem Statement Builder, AIM Reflection Prompts

### **Module 3: Drivers and Design (First School Meeting)**

* Finalize your SMART AIM Statement  
* Identify Primary Drivers (based on selected project strands)  
* Surface Secondary Drivers and Change Ideas  
* Develop a Driver Diagram as your team’s theory of improvement  
  ✅ **Core Output**: SMART AIM \+ Completed Driver Diagram  
  📂 Suggested Tools: Driver Diagram Template, Value/Effort Matrix, Change Idea Prioritization Tool  
  *Note: This module is introduced during the first school visit but often takes multiple sessions to complete. A solid Driver Diagram reflects shared understanding and readiness to test early ideas.*

### **Module 4: Measures and PDSA**

* Develop a basic System of Measures (Outcome, Driver, Process, and Balancing)  
* Select an initial Change Idea to test using a PDSA cycle  
* Plan, launch, and reflect on your first test of change  
* Track learning and identify Bright Spots or pivots  
* Rinse, repeat.  
  ✅ **Core Output**: First PDSA Cycle Plan \+ Learning Measures  
  📂 Suggested Tools: PDSA Planner, Learning Tracker, Measurement Table

### **Final Thoughts**

This is not a compliance checklist\! It’s a strategy for authentic innovation, rooted in empathy, co-design, and a methodical approach to improvement science. Every step helps ensure that students impacted by disruption are not just catching up, but leading the way in shaping a more resilient, equitable, and innovative future for our schools and communities.
