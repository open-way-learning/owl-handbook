### **Module Purpose**

Welcome to Module 0—an optional but highly encouraged reflection and preparation tool for project Innovation Partners before the onboarding workshop. This module bridges your commitment from the \[Exploration & Planning Guide\] to the collaborative work your team will begin at the onboarding kickoff session. It provides space to begin noticing and documenting your current state from a student-centered perspective.

Rather than requiring formal planning, Module 0 is a flexible guide designed to:

* Ground your team in student voice and lived experience  
* Surface early hunches about strengths and challenges  
* Begin identifying patterns and tensions worth exploring

Key thing to keep in mind: *We’re not solving problems for students—we’re solving problems with students.*

### **Step 1: Starting with the Why**

Module 0 helps ensure that your team enters the onboarding session with:

* Observations and understanding about the current student experience  
* Some early questions or tensions to explore (especially ones that emerged or were exacerbated by Helene)  
* Ideas and artifacts that will support your draft the future state you want from this work 

Important: *The WNC Resilience Project is about starting small, learning fast, and staying grounded in what matters most for student success.* 

### **Step 2: A Buffet of Optional Activities you Might Do:**

Pick 1–3 light-lift activities that make sense for your team.

### **Input from Students or Families:** 

* Reflect on conversations you have had with students or families that help you understand what things about their current school experience are working well or not working so well.   
* If possible, reach out to a few students that might be able to provide a diverse set of feedback data via stories, quotes, or examples.

  ### **Reflections as a Team:**

* Have a conversation prior to the onboarding session with your teammates regarding what student-centered challenges feel most worth addressing right now. This can be via an informal team huddle, via email, or phone.

  ### **Review Local Artifacts**

* Applicable attendance or engagement data  
* Recent prior student and/or family survey results  
* Anecdotal input from counselors, SEL teams, or parents  
* Classroom walk-through notes (your own or that of your peers)

Important: *Please use the above (or other) options not as a prerequisite, but as conversation starters.*

### **Step 3: Reflections**

Regardless of what you were able to do for Step 2, reflect on the following prompts:

* What are students saying, doing, or showing that signals what’s currently working well for them and where there might be gaps?  
* What might some of our harder to reach students or parents say about their current school experience?  
* What feels most urgent or most full of possibility, especially in light of what has happened since Helene?

Important: *This step emphasizes reflective listening over planning. Use whatever approach or method that feels natural to document these reflections: journaling, a recording, sticky notes, photos, quick summaries, etc.*

### **Next Steps**

In the Onboarding Session (defined by Module 1), you’ll use what you’ve gathered to:

* Create empathy maps  
* Engage in the Insight Carousel  
* Draft an AIM statement  
* Begin ideating early Change Ideas

These steps build the foundation for your first Driver Diagram and improvement cycle.

***Thanks for taking the time to intentionally prepare for the onboarding session. The most impactful improvement work always begins with deep, empathetic listening and reflection.***
