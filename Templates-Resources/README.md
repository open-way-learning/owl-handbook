## Purpose

This section houses OWL's openly shared tools: templates, models, protocols, thinking routines, checklists, and other practical resources we use in the field and publish under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Everything here is [designed to be remixed](../Admin-HR/it-and-media.md#open-source-licensing-of-materials), adapted, and improved in local contexts while staying grounded in OWL's philosophy and approach.

The DPIV is responsible for maintaining these resources, with changes coordinated through OWL's collective leadership and document control processes. As new tools are finalized in GitBook/GitHub (and moved from Google Drive), they will be added here.

## What you'll find in this section

* **OWL Maturity Model for Student Success**\
  A flexible rubric that describes how the Essential Conditions for Student Success show up in practice, with observable practices, indicators, and actionable steps. It helps schools self-assess where they are, set goals, and design change ideas aligned to deep learning, safety & belonging, high-quality facilitation, and collective teacher efficacy.
* **(Future additions)**\
  This folder will expand to include items such as the WNC Resilience Project Playbook and modules, reflection protocols, thinking routines, advisory tools, and other “grab-and-go” resources that OWL teams and partners use regularly.

## How to use this section

* When planning PD, coaching, or design sessions, **pull tools from this folder** as the default starting point so our work in the field reflects the same open, learner-centered frameworks we share publicly.
* When sharing resources with partners, **link or export from here** so they receive the current version and the appropriate CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution language.
* When proposing a new template or major revision, **coordinate with the DPIV** (and D-OSL/DFO as needed) to ensure it fits within our documentation architecture and is ready for open sharing.

This folder is the living home for OWL's reusable, openly licensed tools—the "public toolkit" that makes our work transparent, adaptable, and easy for others to build on.
