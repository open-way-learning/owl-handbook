# Open Way Learning Employee Handbook 🦉

Welcome to the official Open Way Learning (OWL) Employee Handbook.

This living document is a public resource that outlines how we work, why we work the way we do, and the values that guide everything we do—both internally and externally. Like all organizations, we're subject to relevant laws and policies. But as an [open organization](https://theopenorganization.org/definition/) grounded in collective leadership and the principles of radical transparency, this handbook also serves as the source code for our organizational culture.

> “To scale deep, not just wide, requires being intentional about culture. We see culture not as the soft stuff, but as the operating system that enables everything else.”  
> — *Jal Mehta, Harvard Graduate School of Education*

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This handbook includes guidance on:

- Our mission, vision, and ethos
- Benefits, compensation, and leave policies
- Roles and definitions (employees, fellows, interns, etc.)
- Feedback and growth practices
- Project management and service quality standards
- Tools and procedures for travel, reimbursement, and documentation

## 📎 Governance Documents

In addition to Markdown-based policies, this handbook also includes important governing documents that are hosted in their original formats:

- 📄 [OWL Organizational Chart (PDF)](Governance/org-chart.pdf)

These are located in the `Governance/` folder and are referenced throughout the handbook where applicable.

## 🌱 A Living Document

This is not a dusty PDF sitting in a forgotten drawer. It is a handbook built for iteration—an evolving reflection of our organization as we grow and learn.

We update this handbook often, based on staff input, feedback from partners, and changing needs. If you have an idea for improving it, [propose a change](https://github.com/open-way-learning/owl-handbook/pulls) or share your thoughts via GitBook's comment feature.
