# Open Way Learning Employee Handbook 🦉

Welcome to the official Open Way Learning (OWL) Employee Handbook.

This living document is a public resource that outlines how we work, why we work the way we do, and the values that guide everything we do—both internally and externally. Like all organizations, we’re subject to relevant laws and policies. But as an **open organization** grounded in collective leadership and the principles of radical transparency, this handbook also serves as the source code for our organizational culture.

> **“To scale deep, not just wide, requires being intentional about culture. We see culture not as the soft stuff, but as the operating system that enables everything else.”**  
> — *Jal Mehta, Harvard Graduate School of Education*
