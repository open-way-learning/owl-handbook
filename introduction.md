## Platform Overview & Disclaimers

Welcome! OWL's GitBook platform is your guide to understanding who we are, how we work, and the values that drive our mission to transform education through learner-centered innovation. Whether you're a new employee, a long-time contributor, or an OWL Fellow, this set of core documents is designed to be the codified source of truth that provides clear, transparent guidance about our essential organizational functions and ethos.

Originally written when OWL was a team of one, this set of procedures, policies, templates, etc. has evolved along with our culture over the years as we've operated as a mission-driven nonprofit. We realized early on that future team members wouldn't have the benefit and context of those early days, so that's why we wrote it down - not as a rigid set of rules, but as a living, open-source narrative that distills the lessons, practices, and values that define who we are so that we can continue to refine them together as we grow.

The GitBook platform exists to:

* Codify who we are and how we work, both internally and externally.  
* Reduce confusion and unnecessary interruptions by making information discoverable.  
* Make onboarding easier by clearly showing how we operate.  
* Empower everyone to contribute meaningfully and confidently.  
* Support transparency and alignment across a distributed, mission-driven team.  
* Track and communicate changes, enabling us to evolve with purpose.

A disclaimer: We know this set of documents is a lot. But that's okay. Clarity builds confidence and collective purpose. If you're ever unsure, ask. If something feels outdated or unclear, propose a revision. This is a shared set of documents that you own and embodies the "source code” for OWL's culture. As such, every team member is empowered and expected to not only use them as a guide for how to do one's work, but how we model our values to the world in everything we do. This is the reason we document extensively as an organization, but it is equally important to realize that this documentation does NOT make us a bureaucratic, out of touch organization. In fact, it's the opposite. Our commitment to transparency, asynchronous communication, and collective autonomy is what allows us to move faster, make better decisions, and continually improve. That's the open-source way!

It's also important to know that this set of documents is in perpetual beta! That means they are subject to review, revision, and iteration at any time. Just because something isn't (yet) included doesn't mean it's approved or prohibited. When in doubt, reach out. Interpretation is also welcome, especially when it brings cultural awareness, equity, and inclusivity into the conversation.

To ensure these GitBook documents are always current, relevant, and accurate, all employees are encouraged to routinely suggest updates, refinements, or corrections using GitBook's comment feature or by tagging a Director on OWL's Slack channel to initiate a change. Suggestions are reviewed frequently (at least quarterly OWL's Leadership Team. Refer to the Document Control Policy found in the Strategy-Innovation section below for more details.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each docuemnt on this platform is actively maintained by the designated OWL Director responsible for that respective area of work (e.g. Director of Finance & Operations will maintain the Finance & Operations files). Any proposed changes to the documents in each respective folder should be coordinated with that person for alignment, accuracy, and final approval. These designations are noted at the top of each document, but if you're ever unsure who is responsible is for a section, contact any OWL Director for help.

## Important Legal Disclaimers

We're glad you're here. We hope you'll find the GitBook platform a valuable resource, a reflection of our shared values, and an invitation to co-create the future of OWL—together!

## Definition of Terms

* Officers: The Officers of Open Way Learning include the Leadership Team Officer (LTO), Chair of the Board of Directors, and Treasurer. These individuals are responsible for board governance and operational oversight as required by law and outlined in OWL's bylaws. Officers are members of the Board and serve to uphold fiduciary responsibilities, ensure legal compliance, and provide strategic leadership. Their roles are defined in accordance with applicable nonprofit regulations and OWL's internal governance framework.  
* Board of Directors: The governing body charged with stewarding OWL's mission, finances, and long-term strategic direction. Board members act in a fiduciary capacity to ensure all operations are aligned with OWL's values, legal responsibilities, and strategic goals. Officers also serve as members of the Board. The Board operates as both a sounding board and accountability structure for OWL's leadership, and includes voices with experience in education, nonprofit management, law, finance, and systems innovation.  
* OWL Leadership Team: The core internal leadership group for the organization consisting of the Director of Organizational Strategy & Learning (DOSL), Director of Finance & Operations (DFO), and Director of Program Impact & Visibility (DPIV). Two Leadership Team members also serve on the Board, one as the designated LTO and another as Member-at-Large. While Leadership Team members not serving on the Board do not hold formal governance authority, they collaborate closely with the Board, lead OWL's daily operations, and help shape strategic priorities based on their lived experience with schools and partners.  
* Employer: Open Way Learning (OWL), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Referred to as "OWL,” "the organization,” or "the nonprofit” throughout this and related documents. 
* Employee: Anyone formally hired by OWL—whether full-time, part-time, or temporary—to perform work in support of the organization's mission. Employees receive compensation, may be eligible for benefits, and have their performance directed and evaluated by OWL per their job description and role expectations.

## Employment Classifications

* Full-Time Employee: A full-time employee regularly works at least 30 hours per week. These employees follow a defined scope of responsibilities, maintain consistent work hours, and are generally eligible for the full range of OWL benefits, including health stipends, retirement, PTO, and professional development.  
* Part-Time Employee: Part-time employees typically work less than 30 hours per week, or may have flexible, project-based schedules (e.g., OWL Coaches). They are often assigned specific deliverables tied to Statements of Work. While part-time employees may receive some benefits, eligibility varies based on hours and role.  
* Exempt Employee: An OWL employee paid on a salary basis who meets the legal criteria for exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay, regardless of hours worked beyond 40 per week. This typically includes directors, strategic leads, and others in client-facing or mission-critical roles who are expected to operate with high levels of autonomy.  
* Non-Exempt Employee: An employee paid on an hourly basis and entitled to overtime pay in accordance with FLSA requirements. Accurate time tracking is essential. Non-exempt employees can be full- or part-time and must adhere to documented work schedules. See OWL's Time Tracking Policy and Appendix D of the Code of Conduct for full details.  
* Temporary Employee: A temporary employee is hired on a short-term basis (generally less than six months), either full- or part-time. These employees are only eligible for benefits mandated by law or specifically outlined in their offer letter or agreement with OWL.

## Non-Employee Roles

* Independent Contractor: Also referred to as a consultant, contractor, or OWL Fellow, this is an individual or organization contracted to provide specific services to OWL without being classified as an employee. Independent contractors work autonomously, are not eligible for benefits, and are paid per the terms outlined in a signed Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA). The IRS 20-factor test and OWL's internal guidelines (see Contractor Manual) help ensure proper classification. Contractors are responsible for their own taxes, insurance, and retirement planning.  
* Volunteers: Volunteers donate time or expertise without compensation. Any form of payment, including in-kind perks, would reclassify them as employees under employment law. Volunteers are not covered by OWL's workers' comp insurance and may not deduct their time from personal income taxes.  
* Interns: Internships at OWL are designed to mentor emerging leaders in education and nonprofit work. OWL is committed to equitable internships, meaning all interns are paid at least minimum wage—even if that funding comes from an external partner or grant. Interns may be classified as temporary employees or contractors, depending on their duties. All interns will have a clear job description and written agreement outlining expectations, compensation, and supervision.  
* Hybrid Roles: In some cases, an individual may serve OWL in multiple roles (e.g. as both a part-time employee and a contracted OWL Fellow. In these hybrid arrangements, the terms and benefits associated with each role are determined independently and governed by the respective agreement (i.e. Employment Agreement vs. Independent Contractor Agreement). Employees should consult with the Director of Finance & Operations if they are unsure which policies apply in a given context.

## Employment Statement

Open Way Learning provides each new employee with access to the GtiBook platform when they join the team and expect that in short order, they will be familiar and follow its content (including the Code of Conduct and Ethics document that provides the minimum essential and nonnegotiable items that ensure the highest standards of personal and professional ethics and behavior while associated with Open Way Learning). 

OWL also firmly believes that relationships built on *trust, transparency, inclusivity, and shared purpose* are central to how we work and the kind of culture we aim to cultivate. This is not just a call for professionalism in the traditional sense, but a reflection of the *collaborative spirit* that defines OWL as an open organization. The following is what this means in practice - rooted in the ideals of good judgement, diplomacy, and courtesy:

1. Good Judgment:
* OWL employees are expected to act with integrity and thoughtfulness, making decisions that reflect our mission, values, and commitment to equitable, learner-centered transformation.  
* In an open organization, this also means being mindful of when to act independently and when to invite input—striking a balance between autonomy and collaboration.  
* It includes responsibly handling sensitive information, respecting privacy when needed, and ensuring that communication supports alignment, not confusion.  
2. Diplomacy:  
* Diplomacy at OWL means addressing differences with respect, assuming positive intent, and engaging in constructive dialogue, especially when navigating disagreement or change.  
* It also involves actively listening to diverse perspectives and being able to hold space for complexity and nuance in conversations across roles and communities.  
* As an open organization, we embrace dissent and feedback as vital to growth, but expect these conversations to be anchored in empathy and shared learning.  
3. Courtesy:  
* Courtesy goes beyond politeness; it's about honoring the dignity and contributions of everyone we interact with—colleagues, clients, partners, and community members.  
* This means communicating clearly and kindly, being punctual and prepared for meetings, and showing appreciation for others' time and effort.  
* In the spirit of open collaboration, it also means extending grace, especially in high-pressure or uncertain situations, and assuming that everyone is doing their best.

The above is critically important for OWL's culture as an [open organization](https://theopenorganization.org/) - one that values purposeful transparency, inclusive decision-making, and distributed leadership. These values require a culture where people feel safe to share ideas, ask questions, give feedback, and try new things. The tone and manner in which we engage with one another either builds or erodes that culture. This expectation, then, is not just about individual behavior, but is about sustaining an environment where innovation, equity, and trust can thrive.
