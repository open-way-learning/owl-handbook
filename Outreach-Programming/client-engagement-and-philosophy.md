# Client Engagement and Pricing Philosophy

## Purpose

This document outlines OWL’s approach to pricing its services, developing proposals, and building authentic, co-designed partnerships. It reflects our commitment to access, transparency, and mission-aligned value creation.



## PRICE STRUCTURE FOR OUR SERVICE


OWL believes that learning communities should never be priced out of learner-centered transformation. Our pricing philosophy reflects not just an economic model, but a moral stance grounded in trust, transparency, and our mission.

Our goal is not to be known as “affordable” or “expensive,” but as worth it—because what we deliver is truly unique, deeply customized, and transformational. We bring high-quality, mission-aligned services to schools, districts, and communities at a price that reflects their context and needs, not just our bottom line.

We also believe in something we call market karma: when we show up with integrity, do exceptional work, and focus relentlessly on impact, good things follow. Satisfied partners become loyal advocates. Word spreads. Our reach grows. This is why our best marketing isn’t a slick ad campaign or fancy pitch - it’s the stories schools tell about the inherent value of working with OWL.

We also recognize that no two learning communities are the same. That’s why we do not use fixed, one-size-fits-all rates. Instead, each scope of work is co-designed and priced in collaboration with the client and reviewed by the OWL Leadership Team, with open input from any OWL team member involved.

Value Before Cost

Our services, not surprisingly, are anchored in an open-source mindset:

All core OWL resources (frameworks, tools, protocols) are openly licensed and freely available for use and adaptation.

What clients pay for is not the product, but the amplification of that product’s value through expert facilitation, strategic thinking, design expertise, targeted coaching, and deep culture work.

Doing so means we provide premium services that quicken the pace of progress and help schools truly embed and scale learner-centered innovations in locally sustainable ways. In short: the products are free - our value is in the transformation.

Pro Bono with Purpose

In some cases, we may offer our services at reduced rates or pro bono if we believe the opportunity:

Advances our mission in a high-impact way;

Builds our brand and trust in a new region;

Serves as a long-term investment in a community or network.

We do this strategically, not as charity, but as part of a broader effort to deepen access and equity across education.

Our Pricing Principles

Our approach to pricing reflects the same values that define how we partner, design, and lead:

Collaboration: We price through conversation, not dictate. It’s a partnership from the start.

Results-Oriented: Our pricing reflects the real, measurable outcomes we aim to help our clients achieve.

Efficiency: We keep our estimates and proposals transparent, flexible, and easy to understand.

Equity & Inclusion: We design our pricing so that schools and districts of any size or setting can access what we offer.

Iteration: We encourage long-term partnership, often scaling support as a school evolves (e.g. using the OWL Maturity Model).

Transparency: We clearly communicate what’s included, why it costs what it does, and where we can flex if needed.

How We Set Our Rates

OWL uses a value-based pricing model, not a strict hourly or per-diem system. That means:

We start with the school or partner’s goals, assets, and context.

We estimate the true value of the outcomes we’re co-creating.

Then we design a scope and price that’s fair, feasible, and mission-aligned—for both OWL and the partner.

There are moments when that number is higher than a school expected. There are also times when we go lower than what we “should” charge. That’s the trade-off of doing our mission-driven work the right way, despite what the market might say.

What we won’t do: Let cost be the reason a school misses out on the chance to create something better for students. We will find a way.

ONE LAST THING: BRINGING THE OWL CULTURE TO LIFE (EVERY DAY)

No matter your role, title, or location, you’re part of a team that’s committed to something more than just getting things done - we’re building a culture. One that models what schools themselves should feel like: curious, courageous, joyful, and generous.

So here’s our invitation to you: Let’s not just talk about our values, let’s live them. Let’s bring energy, care, and imagination to the work we do and to the people we do it with.

If you work for Open Way Learning in any capacity, here are some small ways you can help make our culture extraordinary:

Add positive energy to every conversation

Practice “Yes, and…” to build on each other’s ideas

Ask more questions than you give answers

Remove old tasks that no longer serve our mission

Treat clients better than they expect

Offer help before you’re asked

Leave things more organized than you found them

Invent a moment of silliness every day

Highlight good work from your peers

Be on the lookout for future OWLers

Be mindful of costs—but bold in value

Commit to learning and help others grow too

Spark new services that people truly want

Read, explore, and feed your curiosity

Celebrate tough decisions and the clarity they bring

Learn from what didn’t work—and talk about it

And yes… smile a lot

These aren’t rules. They’re reminders of what kind of place we want this to be, and what kind of teammates we want to be for each other.
