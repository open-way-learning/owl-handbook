### **PURPOSE**

This document outlines OWL’s values-driven approach to engaging with clients and partners, from early discovery conversations to final deliverables. It provides guidance on how we collaborate, how we communicate in shared documents and digital spaces, and how we design proposals that reflect mission alignment, contextual fit, and equity of access. It also clarifies our philosophy around pricing, pro bono support, and quality assurance, ensuring that every partnership is co-designed, values-aligned, and focused on lasting impact.

### **HOW WE SHOW UP**

OWL knows that how we show up for our partners is as important as what we deliver.

Everything we do, from how we design proposals to how we manage meetings and structure follow-ups, is rooted in the belief that trust, clarity, and shared purpose are the foundation of any meaningful partnership. Our engagements are not transactions; they are co-learning journeys built on reciprocal respect and mutual investment.

We recognize that most of our clients are schools, districts, and nonprofits navigating complex challenges with limited resources. That’s why we prioritize humility, empathy, and active listening in every interaction, especially in the early stages of discovery and co-design. We will always work to enter every conversation with curiosity, not assumptions.

To reinforce this, we:

* Treat early-stage conversations as opportunities to learn before we advise.  
* Avoid premature “solutions” before practicing empathy and co-defining the goals, context, and constraints with a broad coalition of local stakeholders.  
* Never finalize a proposal in isolation; alignment across our internal team and external partners is foundational to every engagement.

These practices complement and reinforce the facilitation priorities outlined in the “About OWL – Our Approach” document, which describes how we partner with schools to build cultures of learner-centered transformation. That document outlines what we do and how we deliver our services; this one focuses on how we communicate, negotiate, and present ourselves throughout the engagement.

In short: We show up with clarity, integrity, and intention—because our work is not just about delivering services; it’s about building trust for the long haul.

### **PROJECT MANAGEMENT & CLIENT-FACING WORK**

Every OWL project progresses through several key phases, each with specific responsibilities. This workflow applies to both employees and contracted OWL Fellows and is consistent with the procedures outlined in the OWL Contractor Manual.

PHASE 1: Project Launch: 

* A client contract is developed, often informed by a prior intake process or proposal.  
* The contract includes a formal Statement of Work (SOW) that outlines deliverables, timeline, scope, and key personnel.  
* An OWL Project Manager (Primary Contact) is designated, along with a Secondary Contact for redundancy and continuity.  
* For projects involving OWL Fellows, a matching Contractor Scope of Work is issued per the independent contractor agreement.

PHASE 2: Planning & Co-Design:

* The Primary Contact schedules a client intake meeting and additional co-design sessions, often using OWL’s 5P Protocol: *Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance.*  
* The Secondary Contact participates in planning and remains updated on key deliverables, logistics, and decisions to ensure they can step in if needed.  
* Project materials are developed collaboratively and stored in shared OWL folders per the operating guidelines and open-source licensing practices.  
* The Primary Contact confirms responsibilities for any OWL Fellow (e.g., workshop content, tech tools, anchor docs) and ensures alignment with OWL values and brand.   
* During this phase, use these guiding questions to vet Internal Drafts vs. External-Ready Documents:  
  * Is this a rough draft for internal team feedback? If yes, share internally only.  
  * Have the client’s goals, scope, and timeline been collaboratively defined? If yes, the draft is ready for external review.  
  * Is the budget or rate finalized and approved by the OWL Leadership Team? If yes, then and only then include financial details.   
  * Note: When in doubt, label drafts as INTERNAL WORKING DOCUMENT and clarify what input is being requested.

PHASE 3: Delivery of Services:

* OWL Fellows or staff facilitators carry out the sessions (workshops, coaching, etc.) as defined in the Scope of Work.  
* The Primary Contact supports quality assurance by checking in with the client and facilitator(s), offering day-of support if needed.  
* All participants are expected to model OWL’s facilitation values: learner-centered, inclusive, inquiry-driven, and feedback-responsive.

PHASE 4: Follow-Up & Reflection:

* A post-session check-in is initiated by the Primary Contact, which may include a client survey, delivery of session artifacts, and recommendations for next steps.  
* OWL Fellows submit a short trip report or debrief reflection, highlighting strengths, challenges, and suggested pivots.  
* The Primary Contact reviews client feedback and shares growth-oriented notes with the facilitation team.  
* If appropriate, the project is archived and lessons are added to OWL’s internal knowledge-sharing systems.

#### **Key Responsibilities by Role:**

* Primary Contact (Project Lead)  
  * Owns the full scope of the project and serves as the main liaison between the client and OWL team.  
  * Coordinates all planning, co-design, and logistics for the engagement.  
  * Ensures all deliverables align with the Statement of Work and OWL quality standards.  
  * Communicates any changes, risks, or client concerns to internal leadership.  
  * Collaborates with OWL Fellows and staff to model shared leadership while maintaining accountability.  
* Secondary Contact (Support & Continuity)  
  * Maintains awareness of all aspects of the project.  
  * Holds periodic check-ins with the Primary Contact to ensure readiness to step in if needed.  
  * May serve as a sounding board, coach, or design partner throughout the engagement.  
  * Steps in as lead if the Primary Contact is unavailable, ensuring seamless coverage.

#### **Final Notes on Project Management:**

* All project personnel must ensure that work remains within the scope of the client contract or contractor SOW.  
* Any significant changes in service dates, deliverables, or facilitator roles must be approved by the Primary Contact and documented in writing.  
* OWL strives for transparency and continuous improvement; feedback from all parties \- clients, Fellows, and internal staff \- is not just welcomed but expected.  
* For detailed role definitions, invoicing requirements, and facilitator expectations whenever external engagements involve OWL fellows (contractors), refer to the [OWL Contractor Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Amx9PrVgE3YQ2YhXsfH4TOxkXTS-tWJ6AqV4QoSC7j0/edit?usp=sharing).


### **EXTERNAL-FACING DOCUMENTATION**

How we show up in shared digital spaces is part of how we live our values. As such, whether drafting a proposal, co-authoring slides, co-designing a scope of work with a client, or collaborating in a Mural board, our documents should reflect clarity, professionalism, and our deep commitment to openness and co-design.

Most materials we produce, especially those related to our work with schools, should be assumed to be public-facing or sharable unless clearly marked otherwise. This approach not only aligns with our open source principles, but ensures that everything we produce can hold up to public scrutiny.

That said, some documents are intended for internal use only, such as budget worksheets, internal retrospectives, HR records, or rough-draft planning documents. These should be clearly labeled and securely shared with only those who need access.

*A good rule of thumb: Never write or share anything—anywhere—that you wouldn’t stand behind with the OWL logo and your name attached.*


#### **Client-Facing Documents & Draft Proposals**

OWL takes pride in providing customized, co-designed proposals and scopes of work, but only after we’ve had a chance to listen deeply, define the scope, and iterate internally. To that end, we ask that all employees follow this general process:

* Use early conversations with clients to listen, gather context, and build alignment, but always hold off on presenting any detailed budgets, rates, or timelines until OWL’s internal team has had a chance to:

  * Collaboratively review and vet the item internally per the client the request;  
  * Estimate effort using our standard processes.  
  * Clarify expectations and constraints;  
  * Align the proposed work with OWL’s capacity and values.

* Avoid sharing anything that could be mistaken for a final proposal (e.g. draft budgets, daily rates, or scope assumptions) without prior internal vetting by the  OWL Leadership Team.  
* If creating a working doc with external partners, label it clearly as a “Work in Progress” and limit its content to high-level discovery elements:

  * Key goals or desired outcomes;  
  * Possible formats or delivery structures;  
  * Partner assets and constraints;  
  * Draft timeline or metrics (without final cost figures).

We absolutely believe in co-design, but we also believe in producing the highest quality work products and service. That means we keep early drafts simple and focused (less is more) and only share a formal proposal after we’ve completed internal vetting. A proposal should be the final product of our process, not the starting point.

#### **Field Notes, Observations, and Internal Debriefs**

OWL team members often take notes during school visits, workshops, or meetings to support reflection and continuous improvement. These may include internal observations, hunches, or candid assessments. While this practice is encouraged, it is essential to clearly distinguish private reflections from materials intended to be shared, including always writing internal notes with professionalism and care. Even if something is labeled “internal,” assume it could one day be seen by a partner, school team member, or funder.

* Avoid speculation or personal commentary about individuals or school dynamics.  
* Document facts and insights, not assumptions or opinions.  
* When writing something potentially sensitive, ask yourself: *Would this build or harm trust if shared accidentally?*


### If you’re unsure whether a note, doc, or comment thread should be shared or edited, check in with a Director first. 

### **PRICE STRUCTURE FOR OUR SERVICE**

OWL believes that learning communities should never be priced out of learner-centered transformation. Our pricing philosophy reflects not just an economic model, but a moral stance grounded in trust, transparency, and our mission.

Our goal is not to be known as “affordable” or “expensive,” but as worth it—because what we deliver is truly unique, deeply customized, and transformational. We bring high-quality, mission-aligned services to schools, districts, and communities at a price that reflects their context and needs, not just our bottom line.

We also believe in something we call market karma: when we show up with integrity, do exceptional work, and focus relentlessly on impact, good things follow. Satisfied partners become loyal advocates. Word spreads. Our reach grows. This is why our best marketing isn’t a slick ad campaign or fancy pitch \- it’s the stories schools tell about the inherent value of working with OWL.

We also recognize that no two learning communities are the same. That’s why we do not use fixed, one-size-fits-all rates. Instead, each scope of work is co-designed and priced in collaboration with the client and reviewed by the OWL Leadership Team, with open input from any OWL team member involved.

#### **Value Before Cost**

Our services, not surprisingly, are anchored in an open-source mindset:

* All core OWL resources (frameworks, tools, protocols) are openly licensed and freely available for use and adaptation.  
* What clients pay for is not the product, but the amplification of that product’s value through expert facilitation, strategic thinking, design expertise, targeted coaching, and deep culture work.

Doing so means we provide premium services that quicken the pace of progress and help schools truly embed and scale learner-centered innovations in locally sustainable ways. In short: the products are free \- our value is in the transformation.

#### **Pro Bono with Purpose**

In some cases, we may offer our services at reduced rates or pro bono if we believe the opportunity:

* Advances our mission in a high-impact way;  
* Builds our brand and trust in a new region;  
* Serves as a long-term investment in a community or network.

We do this strategically, not as charity, but as part of a broader effort to deepen access and equity across education.

#### **Our Pricing Principles**

Our approach to pricing reflects the same values that define how we partner, design, and lead:

* Collaboration: We price through conversation, not dictate. It’s a partnership from the start.  
* Results-Oriented: Our pricing reflects the real, measurable outcomes we aim to help our clients achieve.  
* Efficiency: We keep our estimates and proposals transparent, flexible, and easy to understand.  
* Equity & Inclusion: We design our pricing so that schools and districts of any size or setting can access what we offer.  
* Iteration: We encourage long-term partnership, often scaling support as a school evolves (e.g. using the OWL Maturity Model).  
* Transparency: We clearly communicate what’s included, why it costs what it does, and where we can flex if needed.

#### **How We Set Our Rates**

OWL uses a value-based pricing model, not a strict hourly or per-diem system. That means:

* We start with the school or partner’s goals, assets, and context.  
* We estimate the true value of the outcomes we’re co-creating.  
* Then we design a scope and price that’s fair, feasible, and mission-aligned—for both OWL and the partner.

There are moments when that number is higher than a school expected. There are also times when we go lower than what we “should” charge. That’s the trade-off of doing our mission-driven work the right way, despite what the market might say.

What we won’t do: *Let cost be the reason a school misses out on the chance to create something better for students. We will find a way.*

### **DRESS CODE & PERSONAL HYGIENE**

In most U.S. education settings, especially at the leadership level, there is an expectation of business casual to business professional attire. School and district leaders often wear slacks, skirts, blouses, dresses, or blazers to model professionalism and distinguish themselves from students. Many teachers are also expected to maintain a standard of professional dress that reflects their leadership role within the school.

Because OWL’s work takes place primarily in these spaces—and often involves working directly with administrators, funders, and policymakers—we aim to show up in ways that reflect both professionalism and respect for our partners’ expectations. How we present ourselves is often one of the first impressions others have of OWL. A professional presence, whether in-person or virtual, helps reinforce our credibility, build trust, and reflect the high quality of work we’re known for.

#### **Face-to-Face Expectations**

OWL team members are expected to dress in clean, well-maintained business casual attire during in-person client engagements such as school visits, workshops, or public-facing events. Business casual does not mean “corporate” — it means being intentional about your appearance in a way that reflects confidence, credibility, and cultural awareness.

Acceptable items include:

* Collared shirts, sweaters (including non-collared, non-athletic sweaters), blouses, dress pants, skirts, or professional dresses  
* Clean, professional footwear (e.g., loafers, boots, flats, or tidy dress sneakers)

Please avoid:

* Athletic wear, distressed jeans, overly casual or revealing clothing, or bold patterns/logos that could be distracting  
* Flip-flops or footwear not suitable for a school or public setting

If a particular setting (e.g., a meeting with funders or a formal school board event) calls for more formal dress, team members should adjust accordingly—adding a blazer, dress shoes, or similar upgrade as appropriate.

#### **Virtual Meeting Expectations**

In virtual environments, the way we show up still matters. OWL team members are expected to:

* Wear clean, professional business casual attire on camera (a blouse, collared shirt, or nice sweater is appropriate)  
* Avoid casual wear such as T-shirts, hoodies, or sleepwear—even if the meeting feels informal  
* Be mindful of grooming, camera framing, lighting, and background to maintain a professional presence

#### **Hygiene and Personal Presentation**

Regardless of setting, team members are expected to maintain basic hygiene and personal care:

* Showering regularly and practicing good oral hygiene  
* Using deodorant to manage body odor in shared or close-contact settings  
* Avoiding strong fragrances that could affect colleagues or clients with sensitivities

#### **The Story We Tell Through Our Presence**

At OWL, we believe that professionalism and personal expression can \- and should \- coexist. We recognize that identity, culture, and comfort all play a role in how people show up. We also understand that education spaces often carry traditional expectations around appearance, especially in leadership-facing settings. Our goal is not to enforce conformity or diminish individuality, but to ensure that how we present ourselves aligns with the trust we aim to build. We ask all team members to approach dress and personal presentation as a form of professional storytelling, where the focus remains on the work we do, not on us as individuals. When in doubt, we encourage collegial conversations grounded in mutual respect and shared responsibility, not enforcement or shame. We trust one another to show up with both authenticity and intentionality.
