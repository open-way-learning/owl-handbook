# **Purpose:** 

This SOP outlines OWL’s standard approach for developing high-quality, learner-centered slide decks and workshop materials. While it provides a shared foundation and includes several non-negotiable expectations (e.g., alignment with OWL’s mission, brand, and professional standards), it is not intended to cover every possible scenario.

In certain cases, such as conference presentations, institutional partnerships, or co-designed sessions with established collaborators, facilitators may adapt elements of the OWL format to:

* Reflect the client’s unique goals and expectations,  
* Integrate the branding or frameworks of partner organizations,  
* Honor local strengths, assets, and context-specific practices.

In these cases, the guiding principle remains the same: deliver engaging, equitable, and high-impact learning that models the OWL values of transparency, co-creation, and excellence. Facilitators are encouraged to collaborate with OWL colleagues when significant adaptations are needed.

# **Guiding Principles:** 

## **Model learner-centered professionalism**

* Peer review content through the lens of equity, inclusion, and accessibility, avoiding language, imagery, or assumptions that could alienate or harm participants \- i.e. never have anything in a slide that could potentially damage OWL’s reputation.  
* Ensure slides are clear, aligned with OWL's values, and uphold professional standards for facilitation in the education space.  
* Our aim is to be polished, inclusive, and humble \- not by designing for perfectionism, but designing for care, cultural responsiveness, and credibility. 

  ## **Honor Brand Consistency**

  ## 

* ## Use the [OWL Branded Slide Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NT4J5w-aA1biGkQwHd03-5h7yyUTvjDGWjxaSjYoQhw/edit?usp=sharing) and this “[Designing the OWL Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LkVGiHVmUiAuJPwp8VULjr96k-qciOOAKe2zaewPCmk/edit?usp=sharing)” guideline whenever planning a client-facing interaction.

* Always use the official OWL template, including standardized colors, fonts, and formatting (reference [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ITPuzP6TV5AC7Bxj59M0Lp6qP-uZ2GMR?usp=sharing) for additional details).  
* Maintain consistency in design to reinforce OWL’s identity, brand, and professionalism.  
* Reference the OWL Code of Ethics & Standards of Conduct, as needed.


  ## **Follow the Design Process as a Throughline**

* The Design Process (as used in OWL’s work) should be reflected throughout the presentation.  
* Structure slide decks to mirror the process of empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing when applicable.  
* Where appropriate, use the [Liberatory Design](https://www.nationalequityproject.org/frameworks/liberatory-design) model, although when time is short or there is the likelihood for confusion, use the traditional [d.school version](https://web.stanford.edu/class/me113/d_thinking.html).

  ## **Incorporate the "What to Expect" Approach**

* Align presentations with OWL’s "What to Expect" structure\*   
  * Exposure to What Works (research, case studies, images of possibility)  
  * Independent Reflection (connecting new learning to prior knowledge)  
  * Collaborative Work Time (sharing, leveraging ideas, and resources)  
  * Practical Adaptation & Goal Setting (time to adapt new knowledge and strategies to one’s own practice, including commitments for follow up)  
  * Targeted Support (prototyping and testing that models learner-centered strategies)  
    

  *\*We call this “The OWL Way” and should be the core framework we use for the majority of OWL’s client-facing services, especially in the early stages of an interaction, where we are establishing relationships, norms, and expectations.*

  ## **Prioritize Clarity and Simplicity**

* Avoid text-heavy slides. Use bullet points, visuals, and concise phrasing.  
* Use the "Less is More" rule: slides should support—not replace—facilitator speech.  
* Avoid images that may create confusion; all visuals should enhance understanding.  
* Follow the 6x6 Rule: No more than six words per bullet point and six bullet points per slide.


| Incorporate Presentation Zen Principles in Every OWL Slide Deck *Design with clarity, restraint, and meaning — not decoration or distraction.* Must Dos: Embrace simplicity and focus. Each slide should communicate one core idea. Eliminate unnecessary text, bullet points, and decorative clutter. Use strong visuals with purpose. Select full-screen, high-quality images that *support* the story, not distract from it. Avoid generic clipart or overloaded diagrams. Prioritize whitespace and contrast. Give content breathing room. Avoid cramming slides with text or visual elements. Practice restraint. Don’t use every animation, transition, or color just because you can. Simplicity adds professionalism and reduces cognitive load. Should Dos: Tell a story visually. Use visuals, metaphors, and image sequences that support the narrative arc of your session (e.g., challenge → insight → solution → call to action). Design for emotional resonance. Use authentic images and language that connect emotionally to educators' real experiences, challenges, and hopes. Rehearse delivery in context. Slides are meant to support your *facilitation*, not serve as a script. Speaker notes should include prompts and pacing to allow for human-centered delivery. Avoid: Overloaded slides with tiny text or dense charts Templates or colors that conflict with OWL’s visual identity Reading slides word-for-word or using slides as handouts (see separate anchor doc guidance) |

  ## **Engagement Through "Show, Don’t Tell"**

* Create slides that foster a high degree of active engagement rather than passive consumption (no sit & get\!).  
* Encourage interaction, inquiry, and reflection through built-in discussion points and activities that use [OWL’s Protocols](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C3JDLnCy12EsHlGew_EGrNBuTlSKMjJeI7EaFhSetpU/edit) and [Thinking Routines](https://pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines).  
* Incorporate discussion prompts, polls, and other interactive elements where appropriate.  
* Reference [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1koa9XeMeR0gVGAM1kZsMlmfo9u9jR4dH?usp=sharing) for example slide deck templates.


  ## **Quality Control Check:**

* Review all slides for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors.  
* Ensure proper alignment, spacing, and readability.


  ## **Use Licensed Images and Resources**

* All images must be [Creative Commons-licensed](https://creativecommons.org/) (including CC0) and properly attributed when required.  
* No copyrighted or unlicensed materials should be included.


  ## **Customize for Each Client and Workshop:**

* Adapt each slide deck to the specific goals of the session.  
* Consider the guiding question: *"What does success look like for this client?"*


  ## **Workshop Working Documents (aka the Anchor Document):**

* Provide participants with a take-home document containing all essential slides, protocols, and resources.  
* This document should be formatted for easy reference and use, being shared so that it is editable for participants.


  ## **Utilize Speaker Notes for Effective Facilitation**

* Clearly indicate who is responsible for each slide.  
* Include key discussion points, facilitator prompts, and estimated timing.

  ## **Plan for Flexibility with Accordion Slides**

* Identify "accordion slides" that can be skipped or expanded depending on session timing.  
* Be prepared to adjust on the fly based on participant engagement and needs.

  ## **Facilitator Adaptability**

* Always be willing to "read the room" and adjust accordingly.  
* Changes should still align with OWL’s approach and intended learning outcomes.

  ## **Conduct a Dry Run (The 5P Rule: Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance)**

* Ensure facilitators are fully prepared before the workshop begins.  
* Test slide transitions, activities, and timing.  
* Have a backup plan, including saving copies in different formats (PowerPoint, PDF, Google Slides) in case of technical issues.


  # **Summary of Best Practices of Professional Learning Facilitation:**

    
1. Organize content in a clear and structured order.  
2. Always provide an overview at the beginning of the presentation.  
3. Avoid overwhelming slides with too much information.  
4. Ensure readability with high-contrast colors and large fonts, use alt text for images, and provide captions for videos where possible.  
5. Incorporate breakout discussions, polling, and other engagement techniques to maintain participant involvement.  
6. Use a structured timeline and identify essential vs. flexible content and always begin and end on time.  
7. Be adaptable and adjust based on engagement and participant needs.

   A final thought: We don’t expect perfection. But we *do* expect thoughtfulness. When in doubt, facilitators should share drafts with colleagues for quick feedback. We’re a learning organization, and we’re stronger together\!
