**Rethinking Measures of Success for Learner-Centered Innovation**

This document outlines Open Way Learning's general approach to assessing the impact of our work with schools and districts. Our goal is to support and measure authentic student learning through a methodical, research-based, and field-tested process grounded in continuous improvement and aligned with what matters most for long-term student success.

Rather than focusing solely on test prep and high-stakes assessments, OWL promotes a more holistic system of measurement that integrates traditional academic goals with powerful indicators of engagement, growth, and real-world readiness. This approach is especially relevant for systems where traditional accountability efforts (e.g., test prep) have yielded limited results, and where educators seek more sustainable and equitable models of improvement.

### **Guiding Principles**

OWL's impact measurement framework is anchored in the following core principles, drawn from best-practice research:

* Learning is multidimensional (cognitive, emotional, behavioral) and must be measured accordingly. \[[Cantor et al., 2019](https://www.nsvrc.org/statistic/2019/5897); [CASEL](https://casel.org/)\]  
* Process data matters as much as outcomes: How we do the work shapes what outcomes we achieve. \[[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching](https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/)\]  
* Improvement requires iteration: We use Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to test and refine innovations over time. \[[Bryk et al., 2015](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED568744)\]  
* Students thrive in environments where they are engaged, empowered, and connected: Engagement is a prerequisite for deep learning and improved outcomes. \[[Lucas Education Research, 2021](https://www.lucasedresearch.org/); [Hattie, 2009](https://inspirasifoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/John-Hattie-Visible-Learning_-A-synthesis-of-over-800-meta-analyses-relating-to-achievement-2008.pdf)\]  
* Authentic learning yields real results: Schools that implement deeper learning, project-based, and experiential strategies see improvements in academic achievement, SEL, and college/career readiness. \[[AIR, 2014](https://www.air.org/project/study-deeper-learning-opportunities-and-outcomes); [Lucas Foundation, 2021](https://www.lucasedresearch.org/research/research-briefs/)\]

### **Framing the Approach**

Our system of measurement is organized around one foundational question and three core improvement questions that ensure both accountability and learning, thus helping schools stay aligned to their goals while nimbly adjusting their strategies in real time:

* **Foundational:** *Have we clearly identified what success looks like—both short and long term?*  
* **Improvement Questions:**  
  * *Are we doing what we said we would do? (Process)*  
  * *Are we doing it well? (Driver-level quality)*  
  * *Is it producing the outcomes we want? (Impact)*

### **Key Concepts & Steps**

**1\. Clarify Success Metrics at Multiple Levels:**

* Define student-centered outcomes aligned with academic, social-emotional, and workforce goals.  
* Identify relevant process and driver measures that influence those outcomes.

**2\. Co-Design and Localize Tools:**

* Collaborate with teachers and school leaders to adapt rubrics, observation tools, surveys, and portfolios.  
* Focus on making learning visible and meaningful to students.

**3\. Prototype and Test:**

* Launch low-stakes PDSA cycles to test strategies and monitor early signals of progress.  
* Document what works, what doesn’t, and what needs to be adjusted.

**4\. Analyze and Share Findings:**

* Use student artifacts, educator reflections, walkthrough data, and stakeholder feedback to triangulate results.  
* Crosswalk new indicators with state and local KPIs for shared accountability.

**5\. Sustain and Scale:**

* Focus on building internal capacity (e.g., peer facilitation, PLCs, leadership development) to drive sustainable growth.

### **From Traditional Metrics to Holistic Measures**

| Traditional Metric | Process Measure | Outcome Measure |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standardized Test Scores | Engagement in authentic learning | Knowledge transfer, real-world problem-solving |
| Attendance Rates | Participation in advisory and voice-based activities | Increased belonging, reduced absenteeism |
| Seat Time/Credit Hours | Flexible pathways, interdisciplinary learning | Competency-based progression and credentials |
| Top-Down Policies | Co-designed strategies, educator agency | Scaled, systemwide learner-centered culture |

### **Conclusion**

OWL's approach is grounded in decades of research and proven implementation experience. Our partners don't just adopt new programs; they build cultures of innovation, equity, and continuous learning that yield measurable and meaningful results for students.

Rather than abandon traditional measures, we help schools enhance them through methods that are more relevant, resilient, and responsive to the students they serve.

#### **Detailed Summary of Student-Specific Impacts**

OWL partners with schools and districts to catalyze learner-centered transformation by embedding high-quality Experiential Learning approaches, design thinking, and collaborative leadership into the fabric of school cultures. These partnerships are not one-time interventions but sustained co-design processes that foster authentic innovation rooted in empathy, equity, and educator empowerment. The impact on students across OWL-supported sites consistently reflects OWL’s mission to empower every learner through experiential, relevant, and equitable learning environments.

* **Empowered Learning Through Student Voice and Authentic Engagement \-** Across multiple sites, students have demonstrated significant increases in self-direction, creativity, and academic agency. In Albuquerque Public Schools, students in the Summer STEAM program took ownership of their learning and applied real-world problem-solving skills in just 12 days of PBL-focused experiences. Teachers noted that students who were once disengaged or behaviorally challenged "blossomed" through meaningful, project-based work that honored their voice and interests.  
* **Academic Growth and Proficiency Through Experiential Learning \-** In McDowell County, NC, a culture of learner-centered math instruction replaced traditional, compliance-driven pedagogy. Students not only gained confidence but showed measurable growth in math proficiency on course-level and end-of-course assessments. Likewise, in Halifax County’s Empowerment Zone alternative school, PBL led to reduced absenteeism and increased depth of student learning, particularly through interdisciplinary projects grounded in local context and entrepreneurship.  
* **Social-Emotional Growth and Sense of Belonging \-** OWL's approach centers empathy as a foundational practice, and students reflect this in their growth. At Bartram Academy, a formerly siloed alternative school in Macon County, student attendance rose from 80% to 85% after a reimagined culture prioritized relationships and support. Graduation rates nearly doubled within two years, demonstrating the power of co-designed learning environments that foster connection, relevance, and purpose.  
* **Workforce Readiness and Real-World Application \-** Through OWL’s Profession-Based Learning (ProBL) initiatives and partnerships with local businesses and colleges, students tackled authentic community challenges, strengthening their understanding of career pathways and workforce demands. Students reported frequent use of in-demand skills such as communication, creativity, and design thinking—skills aligned with the future of work and life. In Caldwell County, teacher perceptions of student workforce readiness rose by 73.68% as a result of these initiatives.  
* **A Culture of Equity, Innovation, and Possibility \-** OWL’s work helps schools move beyond isolated innovations to system-wide shifts that sustain and scale learner-centered practices. In every district—from urban systems like Albuquerque to rural districts like Halifax and Clay Counties—OWL’s support has helped schools cultivate a culture of innovation where student work is public, interdisciplinary, and deeply connected to community. Seven student showcases in Halifax alone reflected this transformation, making learning visible and relevant.

This evidence affirms OWL’s belief that the most meaningful educational outcomes arise when schools nurture the inherent desire of every student to learn and grow through collaborative, inquiry-driven, and equitable learning environments. The data demonstrates that when schools embrace a culture of co-design and continuous improvement, students thrive—not only academically, but socially, emotionally, and as change-makers in their own communities.

### **Attachment 3: *Open Way Learning Service Impact Methodology***

Since its founding in 2018, Open Way Learning has been committed to fostering learner-centered innovation through direct partnerships with schools and districts, as well as professional development workshops for educators. To accurately quantify our reach and impact, as indicated on annual impact reports and on the OWL website, we utilize the following methodology for calculating the number of schools, teachers, and students served. Additionally, we track our pro bono services to ensure transparency in our commitment to equity and accessibility.

1. #### **Schools Served**

   * The primary basis for calculating the number of schools served is our official partner/client list, which includes schools and districts with which OWL has engaged in professional development, coaching, or consultation services.  
   * Each school or district is counted once per year in the total count, regardless of the number of engagements within that year.  
   * For conference-based workshops where teacher cohorts represent multiple schools, we estimate school representation by using participant self-reporting data or regional/national participation norms (e.g., an average of 1.5 schools per teacher cohort).

   

2. #### **Teachers Served**

   * The number of teachers served is based on attendance records from our direct partnerships and professional development sessions.  
   * For multi-day coaching or embedded professional development, the number of participating teachers is counted per distinct engagement (not per session).  
   * For conference workshops, where participation is not tied to a specific school partnership, we use a standard estimate of 15-25 teachers per session based on historical attendance.  
     

3. #### **Students Impacted**

   * Because OWL primarily supports teachers who, in turn, impact students, we use an industry-standard multiplier to estimate student reach.  
   * A commonly accepted ratio for professional development impact is 1 teacher \= 20-30 students per year (based on average class sizes and teacher-student interactions).  
   * For long-term engagements (e.g., multi-year partnerships), the cumulative impact on students is estimated conservatively to avoid over-counting (e.g., assuming an average teacher retention rate within the school system).  
     

4. #### **Tracking Pro Bono Services:** 

   OWL provides professional development and consulting services at no cost to schools or districts that otherwise lack financial resources. We track this work using the following methodology:  
* Direct Pro Bono Services: Schools and districts receiving fully subsidized engagements are included in our overall school and teacher impact calculations, but also categorized separately for transparency.  
* Grant-Funded or Sponsored Programs: Initiatives like the WNC Resilience Project, where external funds are raised to eliminate participation barriers (e.g., covering substitutes, travel, or lodging), are documented based on:  
  * The number of educators whose costs were subsidized.  
  * The percentage of total event attendees receiving financial assistance.  
  * The estimated reach of the initiative, using the same teacher-to-student impact ratio.  
* In-Kind Contributions: Time spent by OWL staff on pro bono work is recorded in internal logs to track service value in relation to our standard consulting rates.
