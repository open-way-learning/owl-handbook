Since its founding in 2018, Open Way Learning has been committed to fostering learner-centered innovation through direct partnerships with schools and districts, as well as professional development workshops for educators. To accurately quantify our reach and impact, as indicated on annual impact reports and on the OWL website, we utilize the following methodology for calculating the number of schools, teachers, and students served. Additionally, we track our pro bono services to ensure transparency in our commitment to equity and accessibility.

1. # **Schools Served**

   * The primary basis for calculating the number of schools served is our official partner/client list, which includes schools and districts with which OWL has engaged in professional development, coaching, or consultation services.  
   * Each school or district is counted once per year in the total count, regardless of the number of engagements within that year.  
   * For conference-based workshops where teacher cohorts represent multiple schools, we estimate school representation by using participant self-reporting data or regional/national participation norms (e.g., an average of 1.5 schools per teacher cohort).

   

2. # **Teachers Served**

   * The number of teachers served is based on attendance records from our direct partnerships and professional development sessions.  
   * For multi-day coaching or embedded professional development, the number of participating teachers is counted per distinct engagement (not per session).  
   * For conference workshops, where participation is not tied to a specific school partnership, we use a standard estimate of 15-25 teachers per session based on historical attendance.  
     

3. # **Students Impacted**

   * Because OWL primarily supports teachers who, in turn, impact students, we use an industry-standard multiplier to estimate student reach.  
   * A commonly accepted ratio for professional development impact is 1 teacher \= 20-30 students per year (based on average class sizes and teacher-student interactions).  
   * For long-term engagements (e.g., multi-year partnerships), the cumulative impact on students is estimated conservatively to avoid over-counting (e.g., assuming an average teacher retention rate within the school system).  
     

4. # **Tracking Pro Bono Services:** OWL provides professional development and consulting services at no cost to schools or districts that otherwise lack financial resources. We track this work using the following methodology:

* Direct Pro Bono Services: Schools and districts receiving fully subsidized engagements are included in our overall school and teacher impact calculations, but also categorized separately for transparency.  
* Grant-Funded or Sponsored Programs: Initiatives like the WNC Resilience Project, where external funds are raised to eliminate participation barriers (e.g., covering substitutes, travel, or lodging), are documented based on:  
  * The number of educators whose costs were subsidized.  
  * The percentage of total event attendees receiving financial assistance.  
  * The estimated reach of the initiative, using the same teacher-to-student impact ratio.  
* In-Kind Contributions: Time spent by OWL staff on pro bono work is recorded in internal logs to track service value in relation to our standard consulting rates.
