# Team Norms and Collaboration

## Purpose

This document outlines OWL’s expectations for internal meeting norms, collaboration practices, and document co-creation. These norms help ensure that our distributed team communicates with intention, clarity, and a shared sense of purpose.



## VALUE ADDED MEETINGS


Synchronous time at OWL is a very valuable commodity. One of the ways we work to honor that time is by ensuring any meeting time you have to do is run efficiently and adds distinct value to your work and the work of your colleagues. To that end, we ask all team members to adhere to the following expectations for any internal, ad hoc meetings:

Start and end the meeting on time.

Be present, or be elsewhere. In other words, if you are not going to be prepared and engaged, then don’t waste the time of your colleagues.

Avoid large meetings that involve 6 or more people, unless you're certain that every participant is providing value to the whole audience (follows the famous Amazon “two pizza”rule - If a meeting can’t feed people with just two pizzas, it’s too big of a meeting).

Avoid frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.

Defer to short meetings (30 minutes) vs long meetings (1 hr or more) where possible.

Every meeting should have a published agenda, ideally the day before it starts so that participants can prepare for efficient sync time to discuss and resolve important subjects. The agenda must include the meeting’s goals and deliverables (preferably no more than three).

Synchronous OWLmeetings should be based on topics that require verbal, face-to-face interaction (including on Zoom). In other words, we only discuss Live Topics in any synchronous OWL meeting, leaving Async Topics for “read only” response and follow up after the meeting. As such, all OWL meetings will include a Google Doc for notes (ideally included in the meeting invitation) for capture and follow up of Async Items so that they do not detract from the core agenda, goals, and deliverables. Where appropriate, important Async Topics should land in the OWL kanban (Productive platform) so that they do not get lost.

Avoid “informational” meetings that address items that could easily be handled via asynchronous communication such as email or Slack.

To ensure that we are holding ourselves accountable to these expectations, every OWL employee is fully empowered to leave or drop off a meeting that does not follow the above criteria or as soon as it becomes obvious you aren't adding value. The rule of thumb is that it is not rude to leave, but it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.

Note that OWL obviously cannot impose these expectations on persons outside the organization that lead meetings for which we participate. Nevertheless, you should model the value of meeting efficiency by emphasizing, as applicable, these expectations when you are given the opportunity to lead an external meeting. You are also welcome to lead through influence by sharing these expectations with non-OWL colleagues, where it is appropriate to do so.

Other Meeting Norms: In addition to the above minimum expectations, OWL also encourages employees to adopt these norms/best practices in order to help OWL meetings be welcoming and safe spaces for open dialogue and problem solving:

Remove Distractions: We know that life happens, especially when working from home. And while we want to bring humanity to the process, we also want to help everyone remain focused on adding value in the time we are together. As such, work to remove distractions from your workspace during the time of the meeting.

Always be Open & Honest: State your views in a transparent manner and ask genuine questions if you do not thoroughly understand something. This enables the team to shift from monologues and arguments to a conversation in which members can understand everyone’s point of view and be curious about the differences in their views. This also means that we use a “Speak now, or forever hold your peace” approach to ensure that what needs to be discussed and resolved in a meeting (or in a formal follow up session) happens and does not devolve to “water cooler talk.”

Share all Relevant Information: This enables the team to develop a comprehensive, common set of information with which to solve problems and make decisions.

Grounding via Context: By using specific examples, the team can see and agree on what important words mean. This ensures that all team members are using the same words to mean the same thing.

Explain Reasoning & Intent: This enables members to understand how others reached their conclusions and see where team members’ reasoning differs.

Tackle Issues, Not People: By moving from arguing about solutions to identifying needs that must be met in order to solve a problem, you reduce unproductive conflict and increase your ability to develop solutions that the full team is committed to. Use a "don't make things personal, and don't take things personally" rule of thumb.

Test Assumptions & Inferences: This ensures that the team is making decisions with valid information rather than with members’ private stories about what other team members believe and what their motives are.

Notice & Reflect on Bias & Systems of Oppression: Similar to the above (and following the design process adopted by the ), take intentional pauses to reflect and notice how the work is proceeding so that it explicitly addresses issues of equity and inclusion and is not reinforcing systems of oppression.

Co-Design Next Steps: OWL is small and nimble enough where we can strive for consensus wherever possible, including input from all stakeholders/users. This ensures that everyone is committed to moving forward together as a team.

Acknowledge the Elephants in the Room: This ensures that the team addresses the important but undiscussed issues that are hindering its results and that can only be resolved in a team meeting.

Follow the 40 Second Rule: Be aware of how long you have been speaking and find a way to hand it off to someone else. This helps share the air and encourages others to engage with the conversation.

In addition to the above criteria for all ad hoc OWL meetings, we also hold routine standing meetings and check in meetings. Those meetings, including their standing agendas, are explained in more detail in


## PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION AND DOCUMENT HANDLING


How we show up in shared digital spaces is part of how we live our values. As such, whether drafting a proposal, co-authoring slides, co-designing a scope of work with a client, or collaborating in a Mural board, our documents should reflect clarity, professionalism, and our deep commitment to openness and co-design.

Most materials we produce, especially those related to our work with schools, should be assumed to be public-facing or sharable unless clearly marked otherwise. This approach not only aligns with our open source principles, but ensures that everything we produce can hold up to public scrutiny.

That said, some documents are intended for internal use only, such as budget worksheets, internal retrospectives, HR records, or rough-draft planning documents. These should be clearly labeled and securely shared with only those who need access.

A good rule of thumb: Never write or share anything—anywhere—that you wouldn’t stand behind with the OWL logo and your name attached.

Client-Facing Documents & Draft Proposals

OWL takes pride in providing customized, co-designed proposals and scopes of work, but only after we’ve had a chance to listen deeply, define the scope, and iterate internally. To that end, we ask that all employees follow this general process:

Use early conversations with clients to listen, gather context, and build alignment, but always hold off on presenting any detailed budgets, rates, or timelines until OWL’s internal team has had a chance to:

Collaboratively review and vet the item internally per the client the request;

Estimate effort using our standard processes (e.g. this );

Clarify expectations and constraints;

Align the proposed work with OWL’s capacity and values.

Avoid sharing anything that could be mistaken for a final proposal (e.g. draft budgets, daily rates, or scope assumptions) without prior internal vetting by the OWL Leadership Team.

If creating a working doc with external partners, label it clearly as a “Work in Progress” and limit its content to high-level discovery elements:

Key goals or desired outcomes;

Possible formats or delivery structures;

Partner assets and constraints;

Draft timeline or metrics (without final cost figures).

We absolutely believe in co-design, but we also believe in producing the highest quality work products and service. That means we keep early drafts simple and focused (less is more) and only share a formal proposal after we’ve completed internal vetting. A proposal should be the final product of our process, not the starting point.

Field Notes, Observations, and Internal Debriefs

OWL team members often take notes during school visits, workshops, or meetings to support reflection and continuous improvement. These may include internal observations, hunches, or candid assessments. While this practice is encouraged, it is essential to clearly distinguish private reflections from materials intended to be shared, including always writing internal notes with professionalism and care. Even if something is labeled “internal,” assume it could one day be seen by a partner, school team member, or funder.

Avoid speculation or personal commentary about individuals or school dynamics.

Document facts and insights, not assumptions or opinions.

When writing something potentially sensitive, ask yourself: Would this build or harm trust if shared accidentally?

If you’re unsure whether a note, doc, or comment thread should be shared or edited, check in with a Director first.
