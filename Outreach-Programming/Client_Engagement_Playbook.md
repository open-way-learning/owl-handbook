# **OWL Client Engagement Playbook**

**Owner:** Director of Program Impact & Visibility (DPIV) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff, contractors/Fellows, and partners who work under the scope of OWL's service to clients

---
## ***Culture, Commitments, and Shared Expectations***

## **0\. How to Use This Playbook**

This Playbook is the one-stop, plain-language guide for how OWL designs and stewards external engagements – from first contact through follow-up and renewal. Use it as:

* a front door when you’re unsure how OWL “shows up” with partners;  
* a checklist when you are scoping, launching, or closing an engagement;  
* a shared reference when coaching Fellows and new facilitators into OWL’s way of working.

The main body explains the essential *why and what*: our engagement principles, PDSA-based phases of work, Program Manager and Secondary Contact roles, expectations for materials, and our stance on pricing and pro bono work.

Over time, detailed “how-to” examples (sample discovery questions, dress-code examples, field note patterns, etc.) will live in short appendices, so the core Playbook stays light and usable.

New staff or Fellows should start with Sections 1–3 and 5, then refer back to specific sections as they plan and debrief engagements.

If this Playbook ever starts to feel too long, confusing, or out of sync with how we actually work, we fix the Playbook, together, rather than creating side documents or one-off norms. The DPIV is the steward of this Playbook and keeps it aligned with OWL’s Strategic Plan, Productive Playbook, and other core SOPs.

## **1.0 Purpose**

This Playbook outlines OWL’s values-driven approach to engaging with clients and partners, from early discovery conversations to final deliverables. It describes how we collaborate, how we communicate in shared documents and digital spaces, and how we design proposals and scopes that reflect mission alignment, contextual fit, and equity of access. It also clarifies our philosophy around pricing, pro bono support, and quality assurance so that every partnership is co-designed, values-aligned, and focused on lasting impact.

Internally, the Client Engagement Playbook sits alongside OWL’s Collective Leadership & Decision Making guide, the Common Roles & Responsibilities for All Directors (including the Director-as-Program Manager role), the Partner Integration Playbook, the Program Delivery RACI, the Productive Playbook, and the OWL Contractor Manual. Together, these documents define how we share decision rights, structure and staff projects, and ensure that what partners experience on the front stage matches how we organize ourselves behind the scenes. One should also read this Playbook alongside *Our Purpose*, *Our Culture*, and *Our Approach*, as these documents describe who we are and what we believe. In short this Playbook turns those commitments into day-to-day practice in how we scope, steward, and renew engagements.

**Key Point:** *Everything in this Playbook is in service of OWL’s mission to co-design ways to amplify the joy and wonder of learning for every student, especially those historically furthest from opportunity. Our work with clients is never just about standalone events; it is about building the conditions for learner-centered cultures to take root and grow over time in local communities.*

### **1.1 Engagement Principles**

How we show up for partners is as important as what we deliver. Our engagements are not transactions; they are co-learning journeys built on reciprocal respect and mutual investment. Most of our clients are schools, districts, and nonprofits navigating complex challenges with limited resources, so we prioritize humility, empathy, and active listening in every interaction – especially in early discovery and co-design.

To keep that true in practice, we:

* **Lead with equity and belonging.** We design every interaction for access across roles, identities, and geographies, with particular attention to learners and communities historically furthest from opportunity. That shows up in who we invite into the room, how we structure participation, and whose stories and assets we center.  
* **Learn before we advise.** Early conversations are for listening, empathy, and sense-making, not pitching canned solutions.  
* **Co-define goals, constraints, and success.** We surface both visible challenges and underlying conditions (culture, leadership, facilitation, student experience), and we name a shared AIM before we lock in a scope.  
* **Anchor to learner-centered practice.** We connect what we hear to OWL’s Essential Conditions for Student Success Maturity Model so that change ideas and PDSA cycles are tied to concrete shifts in culture, instruction, and student experience – not generic PD topics.  
* **Never design alone.** We avoid finalizing proposals in isolation; alignment across our internal team and a broad coalition of local stakeholders is foundational to every engagement.  
* **Work the open source way.** We default to working in the open \- using shared docs, visible decision trails, and iterating in public view \- so partners can see and shape the work with us, not receive it as a finished product.  
* **Play the long game.** We design every interaction – from first email to final debrief – to build trust for the multi-year work required for any culture shift, even when the initial scope is small.

These practices complement and reinforce the facilitation priorities in “About OWL – Our Approach,” found on GitBook. That document describes what we do and how we deliver our services; this Playbook focuses on how we communicate, negotiate, and present ourselves throughout the engagement.

*Bottom line: we show up with clarity, integrity, and curiosity so partners experience OWL as a thought partner, not a vendor.*

## **2.0 Engagement Management**

OWL approaches every client relationship as a collaborative, long-term partnership \- not a one-time transaction. Our values of trust, transparency, co-design, and learner-centered transformation guide how we manage each phase of engagement, from first contact to closeout.

In this context, the Assigned Lead / Primary Contact is the OWL Program Manager (PM) \- typically a Director serving in a PM capacity as described in the Common Roles & Responsibilities document \- and the Secondary Contact is a designated backup PM or Director who can step in to ensure continuity.

Under the hood, every engagement runs on a simple improvement rhythm: Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA) \- we co-design a plan with the partner, support them to try something in practice, study what changes for learners and adults, and then adapt, spread, or exit. For a single workshop, this may be a light-touch loop focused on one team and one strategy; for multi-year, networked initiatives like WNCRP, it becomes a sequenced series of PDSA cycles, ramps, and reflection points.

Across all phases, we use OWL’s Essential Conditions for Student Success Maturity Model as a shared map of learner-centered practice, so that change ideas and PDSA cycles are always anchored in concrete shifts in culture, instruction, and student experience \- not generic PD topics.

**Important:** *As we move through these phases, we honor OWL’s commitment to smart growth over fast growth. We would rather take on fewer, deeper engagements we can deliver with excellence than overextend our team or dilute impact. When a potential scope doesn’t align with our mission, equity commitments, or realistic capacity, we reshape it \- or say no \- so that every “yes” strengthens trust, culture, and long-term results instead of creating fragile, one-off wins.*

### **2.1 – Phase 1: Discovery & Fit (Plan – empathy & context)**

A project begins with a discovery process led by the Assigned Lead (typically the OWL Program Manager / Director in PM capacity), using OWL’s Intake Process and Discovery Template to assess alignment and opportunity. 

In this phase we stay in “learn before we advise” mode \- practicing empathy, surfacing constraints, and listening for both the visible challenges and the underlying conditions (culture, leadership, facilitation, student experience). We begin to connect what we hear to the [Essential Conditions for Student Success Maturity Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1D6Fk31TO9BgjZ_wiHEAaatGu75DQMAeWOPv-EPdXpNM/edit) so that later design work is grounded in specific learner-centered shifts, not just general themes.

### **2.2 – Phase 2: Needs Assessment & Co-Design (Plan – define & ideate)**

If the opportunity moves forward, OWL deepens its understanding of the local context and co-develops a “Solution Sketch.” This internal concept brief helps shape a customized, values-aligned proposal and informs our service model.

Here we blend design thinking (empathy, define, ideate) with improvement science: we start naming a draft AIM (what would success look like for this partner?), early change ideas, and possible measures. For longer-term or networked work, we may use tools such as driver diagrams or Innovation Blueprints to connect the partner’s goals, key drivers, and testable change ideas into a coherent early PDSA roadmap.

### **2.3 – Phase 3: Proposal & Agreement (Plan – scope & guardrails)**

Once a proposal is co-developed, it is internally vetted, shared with the client for feedback, and finalized. The service arrangement is formalized using one of four contracting pathways: OWL Service Agreement; client-provided contract; client-issued Purchase Order (PO) used as the binding agreement when that is the client’s standard procurement mechanism and it clearly references OWL’s proposal/scope; or proposal-as-contract (only if mutually agreed and appropriate). Whenever OWL accepts a client-issued PO or uses a proposal-as-contract, the Assigned Lead (PM) must ensure there is a brief Statement of Work (SOW) that translates the approved amount into a clear scope, timeline, roles (including any contractors/Fellows), and invoicing plan for internal and partner use.

For multi-session or multi-year engagements, the proposal and SOW should also name the initial PDSA focus (for example, “one team, one practice, one learner group”) and outline the expected engagement rhythm (check-ins, site visits, coaching calls, artifact production, and formal reflection points).

### **2.4 – Phase 4: Launch Preparation (Plan – set the rhythm)**

The Assigned Lead schedules a kickoff planning meeting with the client to confirm logistics, expectations, team roles, and access needs. Key documents and planning tools are maintained in shared OWL folders using open-source protocols.

The kickoff is also where we **lock in the engagement rhythm**: we calendar the first round of sessions and coaching, agree on when and how we will capture Bright Spots and artifacts, and confirm how quick data (surveys, exit tickets, student work, story capture) will feed into regular “Study” moments in our PDSA cycles.

### **2.5 – Phase 5: Implementation, PDSA & Renewal Pathway (Do–Study–Act)**

Service delivery is coordinated by the Assigned Lead and carried out by OWL facilitators and Fellows. For multi-organization work (e.g., WNCRP), the PM should also use OWL’s Program Delivery RACI to clarify task-level responsibilities across OWL staff, Fellows, and External Partner Leads.

OWL teams are expected to:

* Model our facilitation values (inclusive, inquiry-driven, feedback-responsive).  
* Use reflection tools, design sprints, and real-time improvement practices (especially Plan–Do–Study–Act cycles and minimum viable prototypes) as the backbone of our work, not an add-on.  
* Conduct periodic project health checks, especially during longer or high-stakes projects, using simple data plus stories to decide whether to adapt, spread, or exit.

In practice, this looks different depending on the engagement type:

* Short engagements (e.g., a single workshop or sprint) run at least one light-touch PDSA cycle: co-define a focus, try a strategy with participants, reflect together on what changed, and name clear next steps for the partner.  
* Multi-session or networked engagements (WNCRP, CAPS, TWL, etc.) run on predictable PDSA rhythms \- for example, monthly touchpoints, quarterly Bright Spots / Proof Points, and annual “ramp” reflections that feed directly into renewal or redesign conversations.

Across these contexts, facilitators continually connect what they’re seeing back to the Essential Conditions Maturity Model so that we can say, in plain language, *how* classroom practice, student experience, and collective efficacy are shifting \- not just that we ran events. In short, we explicitly operate in “[perpetual beta](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescoachescouncil/2021/08/06/effective-leadership-development-in-perpetual-beta/).” We embrace non-closure by treating each agenda, prototype, and cycle as a test bed for learning \- not a finished product \- so that both OWL and our partners can name what’s working, what isn’t, and what we’ll adjust together next.

**Important:** *We also explicitly name capacity-building early on in our engagements. Much like Outward Bound’s “Train–Main–Final” model, our goal is to move from OWL-led design and facilitation, to shared leadership, to the partner leading with OWL in a lighter-touch coaching role. Renewals are not about keeping OWL in the driver’s seat; they are about widening and deepening impact while shifting more ownership, confidence, and skill to local teams over time.*

### **2.6 – Phase 6: Follow-Up & Reflection (Study & Act – close the loop)**

Following each engagement:

* A post-session check-in is conducted with the client to capture quick feedback and clarify what they will try next.  
* Facilitators and OWL Fellows complete a reflection or trip report, including any emerging Bright Spots, tensions, or PDSA learning.  
* Internal lessons learned are shared across the team (e.g., in \#decision\_log, debrief meetings, or initiative-specific channels) so that patterns inform future design.  
* Opportunities for continued or renewed partnership are surfaced and shared with OWL leadership, including a draft idea for the next set of PDSA cycles when appropriate.

When we talk about “what’s next,” we avoid fluff. Renewal and scaling conversations are grounded in evidence and stories of impact: what has changed for learners and adults, where capacity has grown, and where the partner is ready to take more ownership. A healthy renewal often looks like *more people, deeper work, lighter OWL*, not endless dependence on our team.

The above is part of OWL’s identity as a [learning organization](https://whatfix.com/blog/learning-organization/): we don’t just deliver services, we learn in public with our partners and feed that learning back into how we design, facilitate, and measure future engagements.

### **2.7 – Renewal, Scaling, and Working Ourselves Out of a Job**

OWL is not a “canned PD provider.” Our best work helps partners build the mindsets, tools, and routines they need to continue improving long after a specific workshop series or grant cycle ends. That means we design every engagement with two intertwined goals:

* **Sustained culture shift** in classrooms, teams, and systems, and  
* **Decreased reliance on OWL** as local capacity grows.

In practice, we think about this as a loose **Train → Main → Final** progression:

* **Train:** OWL does more of the heavy lifting. We model learner-centered practices, introduce PDSA and design tools, and help leaders see and name the Essential Conditions they want to grow.  
* **Main:** Ownership becomes shared. Local leads co-design and co-facilitate, run their own PDSA cycles with coaching, and begin to spread Bright Spots and Proof Points within their own networks. OWL’s role shifts toward coaching, feedback, and helping teams make sense of emerging data.  
* **Final:** The partner owns the work. OWL provides light-touch support \- targeted coaching, occasional design sprints, or help with storytelling and measurement \- while local teams lead the design, facilitation, and improvement cycles.

**Renewals and expansions** should reflect where a partner is on this arc. When we scope follow-on work, we ask:

* How has local capacity grown?  
* What could they now do without us that they couldn’t before?  
* Where would targeted OWL support unlock the next level of spread, depth, or resilience?

For example, a renewal might:

* move from one pilot team to multiple schools or departments;  
* focus on coaching and internal facilitation capacity rather than OWL-led workshops; or  
* narrow to a specific strand (e.g., assessment, student agency, advisory) where the partner wants deeper design support.

In every case, stories of impact plus simple evidence (student work, surveys, attendance, engagement, artifacts from the PDSA process, etc.) are the starting point. We want partners \- and funders \- to be able to say, in plain language:

*“Here’s what changed. Here’s how we know. Here’s how we’re carrying it forward \- with a smaller, smarter role for OWL over time.”*

That is how we span and scale the work without burning out our team or creating dependency: we design for renewal where it deepens and spreads impact, and we design for exit where local teams are ready to lead.

## **3.0 The Program Manager in OWL Engagements**

In most OWL engagements, the Primary Contact is a Director serving in a Program Manager (PM) capacity. As described in the [Common Roles & Responsibilities for All Directors](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1_9y8w-tarZIhcNENVp4r7K3Y_4ym1GIDzMmdodN2rCg/edit), PMs are often the tip of the spear for OWL’s work \- the first and most consistent point of contact for a school, district, or external partner. They are not just coordinating logistics; they are actively shaping how OWL shows up, builds trust, centers equity and belonging, ensures accountability, and lives our commitments in the field. Their leadership sets the tone for the partnership and lays the groundwork for shared success.

The Common R\&R document is the canonical source for Director-as-PM expectations, including how PMs:

* scope engagements with clear outcomes, deliverables, timelines, roles, and measures of success;  
* steward renewals and expansion opportunities via the CRM;  
* secure and manage consents, data-sharing agreements, and MOUs while upholding FERPA/PII and client-specific privacy protocols; and  
* ensure compliance with contract-specific documentation and onboarding requirements (COIs, background checks, travel approvals, etc.) in coordination with the DFO.

This Playbook adds a client-engagement lens to that role. Within the lifecycle described in Section 2, the PM is responsible for:

* **Using the engagement phases and PDSA rhythm intentionally.** Making sure each phase (Discovery & Fit, Co-Design, Proposal & Agreement, Launch, Implementation/PDSA, Follow-Up & Reflection, Renewal) is visible and planned for, not assumed.

* **Translating scope into a workable rhythm.** Converting the approved scope and budget into a calendarized pattern of site visits, virtual touchpoints, coaching sessions, and artifact production that is reflected in Productive, the OWL CRM, and the Service Staffing Calendar.

* **Maintaining the Train → Main → Final arc.** Naming and revisiting how ownership shifts over time \- from OWL-led to shared to partner-led \- so renewals and expansions deepen impact and local capacity rather than extending dependence on OWL.

* **Aligning facilitation with learner-centered practice.** Working with facilitators and Fellows to connect agendas, protocols, and PDSA cycles to OWL’s Essential Conditions for Student Success Maturity Model so that the work stays anchored in concrete shifts in culture, instruction, and student experience.

* **Using systems as the single source of truth.** Ensuring that scopes, budgets, staffing plans, and key decisions are captured in our core systems (Productive, CRM, GitBook/Drive) rather than in side documents or personal inboxes.

A **Secondary Contact** (usually another Director like the DFO) is identified for each engagement. Their role is to provide redundancy and backup: they stay aware of the overall engagement status, can step in for the PM when needed, and serve as an additional point of contact for complex decisions or risks.

**Bottom line:** the Common R\&R defines what Directors-as-PMs are responsible for across OWL. This Playbook shows how that role moves through the life of an engagement \- using our phases, PDSA framework, and systems to deliver high-quality, sustainable work for partners and for our team.

## **4.0 Engagement Materials**

How we show up in shared digital spaces is part of how we live our values. As such, whether drafting a proposal, co-authoring slides, co-designing a scope of work with a client, or collaborating in a Mural board, our documents should reflect clarity, professionalism, and our deep commitment to openness and co-design.

Most materials we produce, especially those related to our work with schools, should be assumed to be public-facing or sharable unless clearly marked otherwise. This approach not only aligns with our open source principles, but ensures that everything we produce can hold up to public scrutiny.

That said, some documents are intended for internal use only, such as budget worksheets, internal retrospectives, HR records, or rough-draft planning documents. These should be clearly labeled and securely shared with only those who need access.

In practice, most OWL engagements generate a small set of “signature artifacts” that partners come to recognize:

* co-designed agendas and slide decks that model our facilitation values and protocols;  
* living planning docs (e.g., Innovation Blueprints, early driver diagrams, or PDSA plans);  
* reflection tools (journals, debrief protocols, trip reports) that help teams study change;  
* Bright Spot and Proof Point stories that capture both narrative and evidence.

These artifacts should be easy to find in shared folders, clearly labeled, and written as if they may one day be shared publicly – unless marked otherwise.

*A good rule of thumb: Never write or share anything \- anywhere \- that you wouldn’t stand behind with the OWL logo and your name attached.*

**Important:** Unless a partner requests otherwise, client-facing tools and resources we create are licensed under OWL’s standard Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA) license so others can adapt and build on them in their own context. For more on how this connects to OWL’s open-source culture and documentation expectations, see *Our Culture* and the OWL Code of Ethics & Standards of Conduct.

#### 

### **4.1 Client-Facing Documents & Draft Proposals**

All proposals must go through an internal review and co-design process before sharing with a client. Early-stage drafts should:

* Be clearly labeled as “Internal Working Document” or “For Feedback Only”  
* Avoid line-item budgets or internal rates unless specifically requested by the client  
* Focus on values-aligned goals, potential service models, and known constraints

OWL’s “less is more” principle applies to all external communications in the early phases of engagement.

### **4.2 Field Notes, Observations, and Internal Debriefs**

We take notes during school visits, workshops, and meetings to support reflection and continuous improvement. These notes should always be written with professionalism and care, on the assumption that they may someday be seen by a partner or funder.

At a minimum:

* distinguish clearly between facts, hunches, and opinions;  
* avoid speculation or personal commentary about individuals; and  
* ask, “Would this build or harm trust if it were shared accidentally?”

## **5.0 Value Over Cost**

OWL believes that learning communities should never be priced out of learner-centered transformation. Our pricing philosophy reflects not just an economic model, but a moral stance grounded in trust, transparency, and our mission.

Our goal is not to be known as “affordable” or “expensive,” but as “well worth it” because what we deliver is truly unique, deeply customized, and transformational. We bring high-quality, mission-aligned services to schools, districts, and communities at a price that reflects their context and needs, not just our bottom line. Our pricing is also grounded in the realities of our primary partners \- educators and school systems \- not corporate training markets, so that what we offer is both sustainable for OWL and realistically accessible for schools.

We also believe in something we call market karma: when we show up with integrity, do exceptional work, and focus relentlessly on impact, good things follow. Satisfied partners become loyal advocates. Word spreads. Our reach grows. This is why our best marketing isn’t a slick ad campaign or fancy pitch \- it’s the stories schools tell about the inherent value of working with OWL.

We also recognize that no two learning communities are the same. That’s why we do not use fixed, one-size-fits-all rates. Instead, each scope of work is co-designed and priced in collaboration with the client and reviewed by the OWL Leadership Team, with open input from any OWL team member involved.

Our services, not surprisingly, are anchored in an open-source mindset:

* All core OWL resources (frameworks, tools, protocols) are openly licensed and freely available for use and adaptation.  
* What clients pay for is not the product, but the amplification of that product’s value through expert facilitation, strategic thinking, design expertise, targeted coaching, and deep culture work.

Doing so means we provide premium services that quicken the pace of progress and help schools truly embed and scale learner-centered innovations in locally sustainable ways. In short: the products are free \- our value is in the transformation.

### **5.1 Our Pricing Principles**

Our approach to pricing reflects the same values that define how we partner, design, and lead:

* Collaboration: We price through conversation, not dictate. It’s a partnership from the start.  
* Results-Oriented: Our pricing reflects the real, measurable outcomes we aim to help our clients achieve.  
* Efficiency: We keep our estimates and proposals transparent, flexible, and easy to understand.  
* Equity & Inclusion: We design our pricing so that schools and districts of any size or setting can access what we offer.  
* Iteration: We encourage long-term partnership, often scaling support as a school evolves (e.g. using the OWL Maturity Model).  
* Transparency: We clearly communicate what’s included, why it costs what it does, and where we can flex if needed.

### **5.2 How We Set Our Rates**

OWL uses a value-based pricing model, not a strict hourly or per-diem system. That means:

* We start with the school or partner’s goals, assets, and context.  
* We estimate the true value of the outcomes we’re co-creating.  
* Then we design a scope and price that’s fair, feasible, and mission-aligned \- for both OWL and the partner.

There are moments when that number is higher than a school expected. There are also times when we go lower than what we “should” charge. That’s the trade-off of doing our mission-driven work the right way, despite what the market might say. That said, final pricing and terms are approved by the Director of Finance & Operations (DFO) in line with OWL’s ROI guardrails and the Collective Leadership & Decision Making framework to ensure strategic fits and long-term sustainability as a nonprofit.

In practice, we use the OWL Service Estimator and Productive budgets to stress-test scopes against our contribution-margin guardrails, travel and pass-through assumptions, and cash-flow realities – always in partnership between the PM, DPIV, and DFO.

What we won’t do: *Let cost be the reason a school misses out on the chance to create something better for students. We will find a way.* 

When we flex on price or structure, we do so with equity in mind: prioritizing communities and learner groups historically furthest from opportunity, and being transparent internally about when and why we are treating an engagement as a strategic, mission-aligned investment. This also includes, in some cases, offering our services at reduced rates or pro bono if we believe the opportunity:

* Advances our mission in a high-impact way;  
* Builds our brand and trust in a new region;  
* Serves as a long-term investment in a community or network.

We do this strategically, not as charity, but as part of a broader effort to deepen access and equity across education.

## **6.0 Professional Presence**

When we step into workshops, design sprints, or strategy sessions with clients and partners, we’re not just leading content, we’re modeling culture. OWL facilitators are expected to operate as [warm demanders](https://resources.corwin.com/sites/default/files/13._figure_6.2_warm_demander_chart.pdf) in external engagements: combining structure with humanity, holding space for multiple perspectives, and keeping the work on track.

In facilitation spaces, we:

* Hold both structure and flexibility. Participants should always know why we’re doing something \- and feel safe to ask why not.  
* Set and revisit norms. Use visible norms like “step up/step back,” “embrace non-closure,” and “critique the work, not the person.”  
* Center belonging. Design for multiple modes of participation \- voice, chat, sticky notes, silent reflection, and visuals.  
* Invite productive discomfort. Normalize critical reflection without requiring forced vulnerability.  
* Model shared responsibility. If we want collaborative classrooms, we have to lead collaborative rooms.

**Important:** *When planning any session, facilitators should cross-check their design against the Tier 1 “non-negotiables” and Tier 2 best practices in “About OWL” (on GitBook) to ensure every engagement models the core OWL way of working, not just its content.*

#### **Suggested Workshop Norms:**

* Take care of yourself and each other  
* Be fully present  
* Embrace productive struggle  
* Critique the work, not the person  
* Step up/Step back  
* Embrace and accept non-closure   
* Practice “[Yes, and…](https://medium.com/improv4/saying-yes-and-a-principle-for-improv-business-life-fd050bccf7e3)” 

#### **Tech Etiquette (Virtual Sessions):**

* Keep your camera on when possible \- it helps humanize the space  
* Use chat actively to uplift quiet voices or affirm contributions  
* Avoid multitasking (unless life or caregiving happens \- we get it)  
* Use a tidy background and steady framing to reduce distractions  
* Have shared tools ready (e.g. sticky notes, reflection journal, Jamboard, Pear Deck, etc.)

Remember that strong facilitation is an act of strong leadership. It’s not just about what we deliver, it’s about what we help others see in themselves. The above norms provide a framework that enables us to model how we live OWL’s mission, treating collaboration as a shared craft. As such, we revisit, revise, and re-commit to these norms regularly, knowing that they help us show up with purpose, generosity, and courage in every space we enter.

#### **Professional Presence**

How we show up – in person and online – is part of the story we tell about OWL. In most U.S. education settings, especially at the leadership level, there is a clear expectation of business-casual professionalism. Because we work directly with administrators, funders, and policymakers, we commit to showing up in ways that reflect respect for local norms, our partners’ time, and the quality of our work.

Our stance is simple:

* Dress and present yourself in a way that would make you comfortable walking into a principal’s office, school board meeting, or funder convening.  
* Balance professionalism with authentic expression, cultural humility, and context (for example, site visits that involve outdoor work or hands-on student projects).  
* Assume that cameras are on in virtual spaces and that how we show up there matters as much as in person.  
* Approach any feedback about dress or presence as collegial coaching in service of trust, not enforcement or shame.

We recognize that identity, culture, and comfort all play a role in how people show up. Our goal is not to enforce conformity, but to ensure that our presence aligns with the trust we aim to build so the focus stays on the work, not on us as individuals.

## **Appendix 1 \- Client-Facing Resources**

# 

**Purpose:** This appendix outlines OWL’s standard approach for developing high-quality, learner-centered slide decks and workshop materials. While it provides a shared foundation and includes several non-negotiable expectations (e.g., alignment with OWL’s mission, brand, and professional standards), it is not intended to cover every possible scenario.

In certain cases, such as conference presentations, institutional partnerships, or co-designed sessions with established collaborators, facilitators may adapt elements of the OWL format to:

* Reflect the client’s unique goals and expectations,  
* Integrate the branding or frameworks of partner organizations,  
* Honor local strengths, assets, and context-specific practices.

In these cases, the guiding principle remains the same: deliver engaging, equitable, and high-impact learning that models the OWL values of transparency, co-creation, and excellence. Facilitators are encouraged to collaborate with OWL colleagues when significant adaptations are needed.

### **Guiding Principles:** 

**Model learner-centered professionalism**

* Peer review content through the lens of equity, inclusion, and accessibility, avoiding language, imagery, or assumptions that could alienate or harm participants \- i.e. never have anything in a slide that could potentially damage OWL’s reputation.  
* Ensure slides are clear, aligned with OWL's values, and uphold professional standards for facilitation in the education space.  
* Our aim is to be polished, inclusive, and humble \- not by designing for perfectionism, but designing for care, cultural responsiveness, and credibility. 

**Honor Brand Consistency**

* Use the [OWL Branded Slide Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NT4J5w-aA1biGkQwHd03-5h7yyUTvjDGWjxaSjYoQhw/edit?usp=sharing) and this “[Designing the OWL Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LkVGiHVmUiAuJPwp8VULjr96k-qciOOAKe2zaewPCmk/edit?usp=sharing)” guideline whenever planning a client-facing interaction.  
* Always use the official OWL template, including standardized colors, fonts, and formatting (reference [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ITPuzP6TV5AC7Bxj59M0Lp6qP-uZ2GMR?usp=sharing) for additional details).  
* Maintain consistency in design to reinforce OWL’s identity, brand, and professionalism.  
* Reference the OWL Code of Ethics & Standards of Conduct, as needed.


**Follow the Design Process as a Throughline**

* The Design Process (as used in OWL’s work) should be reflected throughout the presentation.  
* Structure slide decks to mirror the process of empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing when applicable.  
* Where appropriate, use the [Liberatory Design](https://www.nationalequityproject.org/frameworks/liberatory-design) model, although when time is short or there is the likelihood for confusion, use the traditional [d.school version](https://web.stanford.edu/class/me113/d_thinking.html).

**Incorporate the "What to Expect" Approach**

* Align presentations with OWL’s "What to Expect" structure\*   
  * Exposure to What Works (research, case studies, images of possibility)  
  * Independent Reflection (connecting new learning to prior knowledge)  
  * Collaborative Work Time (sharing, leveraging ideas, and resources)  
  * Practical Adaptation & Goal Setting (time to adapt new knowledge and strategies to one’s own practice, including commitments for follow up)  
  * Targeted Support (prototyping and testing that models learner-centered strategies)  
    

  *\*We call this “The OWL Way” and should be the core framework we use for the majority of OWL’s client-facing services, especially in the early stages of an interaction, where we are establishing relationships, norms, and expectations.*

**Prioritize Clarity and Simplicity**

* Avoid text-heavy slides. Use bullet points, visuals, and concise phrasing.  
* Use the "Less is More" rule: slides should support \- not replace \- facilitator speech.  
* Avoid images that may create confusion; all visuals should enhance understanding.  
* Follow the 6x6 Rule: No more than six words per bullet point and six bullet points per slide.

**Engagement Through "Show, Don’t Tell"**

* Create slides that foster a high degree of active engagement rather than passive consumption (no sit & get\!).  
* Encourage interaction, inquiry, and reflection through built-in discussion points and activities that use [OWL’s Protocols](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1C3JDLnCy12EsHlGew_EGrNBuTlSKMjJeI7EaFhSetpU/edit) and [Thinking Routines](https://pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines).  
* Incorporate discussion prompts, polls, and other interactive elements where appropriate.  
* Reference [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1koa9XeMeR0gVGAM1kZsMlmfo9u9jR4dH?usp=sharing) for example slide deck templates.


**Quality Control Check:**

* Review all slides for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors.  
* Ensure proper alignment, spacing, and readability.


**Use Licensed Images and Resources**

* All images must be [Creative Commons-licensed](https://creativecommons.org/) (including CC0) and properly attributed when required.  
* No copyrighted or unlicensed materials should be included.


**Customize for Each Client and Workshop:**

* Adapt each slide deck to the specific goals of the session.  
* Consider the guiding question: *"What does success look like for this client?"*


**Workshop Working Documents (aka the Anchor Document):**

* Provide participants with an editable take-home document that mirrors key workshop content and includes only the most essential slides, prompts, and protocols to support reflection and collaboration, not a comprehensive manual.  
* This document should be formatted for easy reference and use, being shared so that it is editable for participants.


**Utilize Speaker Notes for Effective Facilitation**

* Clearly indicate who is responsible for each slide.  
* Include key discussion points, facilitator prompts, and estimated timing.

**Plan for Flexibility with Accordion Slides**

* Identify "accordion slides" that can be skipped or expanded depending on session timing.  
* Be prepared to adjust on the fly based on participant engagement and needs.

**Facilitator Adaptability**

* Always be willing to "read the room" and adjust accordingly.  
* Changes should still align with OWL’s approach and intended learning outcomes.

**Conduct a Dry Run (The 5P Rule: Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance)**

* Ensure facilitators are fully prepared before the workshop begins.  
* Test slide transitions, activities, and timing.  
* Have a backup plan, including saving copies in different formats (PowerPoint, PDF, Google Slides) in case of technical issues.

### **Incorporate Presentation Zen Principles in Every OWL Slide Deck**

### 

* Design with clarity, restraint, and meaning  \-  not decoration or distraction.  
* Embrace simplicity and focus. Each slide should communicate one core idea. Eliminate unnecessary text, bullet points, and decorative clutter.  
* Use strong visuals with purpose. Select full-screen, high-quality images that support the story, not distract from it. Avoid generic clipart or overloaded diagrams.  
* Prioritize whitespace and contrast. Give content breathing room. Avoid cramming slides with text or visual elements.  
* Practice restraint. Don’t use every animation, transition, or color just because you can. Simplicity adds professionalism and reduces cognitive load.  
* Always try to tell a story with visuals, metaphors, and image sequences that support the narrative arc of your session (challenge → insight → solution → call to action).  
* Design for emotional resonance with authentic images and language that connect to educators' real experiences, challenges, and hopes.  
* Rehearse delivery in context. Slides are meant to support your facilitation, not serve as a script. Speaker notes should include prompts and pacing to allow for human-centered delivery and flexibility.  
* Avoid:  
  * Overloaded slides with tiny text or dense charts  
  * Templates or colors that conflict with OWL’s visual identity  
  * Reading slides word-for-word or using slides as handouts (see separate anchor doc guidance)

### **Use of Full-Length “Workbooks”**

While OWL values resource-rich tools to support long-term educator growth, comprehensive workbooks should not be used as the primary resource during initial workshops unless explicitly aligned with the context of a multi-session engagement where strong trust, norms, and scaffolding have been established.

In most cases, the Anchor Document model should be used \- a simplified, participant-friendly version that mirrors the key workshop slides and includes space for reflection, shared protocols, and take-home planning prompts. This document ensures:

* Clarity and alignment with OWL’s facilitation style  
* Reduced cognitive overload  
* Protection of collaborative meaning-making

**Why this matters:** In previous engagements, we have found that lengthy workbooks can unintentionally prompt individual “fill-in-the-blank” behavior or overwhelm participants, reducing collaboration and undermining learner-centered facilitation.

### **Use of Partner Materials in OWL Sessions:** 

When collaborating with external partners or invited facilitators (e.g., guest speakers, district leaders), OWL facilitators should:

* Keep external slide decks or materials in their original format unless explicitly asked to reformat in OWL’s style.  
* Introduce the partner by name, context, and the reason for including their unique voice.  
* Use this contrast as a learning opportunity \- showing how different organizations or leaders approach similar challenges.

Why this matters: OWL maintains a high standard of visual and pedagogical quality in its slide design and materials. Rather than risk diluting that by over-editing external resources, we respect the source material and model openness, humility, and contextually responsive facilitation.

### **Summary of Best Practices of Professional Learning Facilitation:**

1. Organize content in a clear and structured order.  
2. Always provide an overview at the beginning of the presentation.  
3. Avoid overwhelming slides with too much information.  
4. Ensure readability with high-contrast colors and large fonts, use alt text for images, and provide captions for videos where possible.  
5. Incorporate breakout discussions, polling, and other engagement techniques to maintain participant involvement.  
6. Use a structured timeline and identify essential vs. flexible content and always begin and end on time.  
7. Be adaptable and adjust based on engagement and participant needs.

   A final thought: We don’t expect perfection. But we *do* expect thoughtfulness. When in doubt, facilitators should share drafts with colleagues for quick feedback. We’re a learning organization, and we’re stronger together\!

## **Appendix 2 \- Example Client Proposal**

The following example shows a clean, plain-language proposal you can tailor to any district or school. It frames the “why,” outlines scope and milestones, and presents one all-in services price. It’s also designed to align with the OWL Estimator Tool and our preferred terms (≥45% margin floor, travel at cost, 2–3% ops/compliance on services, deposit, etc.) while staying district-friendly and jargon-free. You can quickly adapt it in the following ways: 

* **For a proposal:** Make a copy and then update names, dates, focus areas, and the services total pulled from the Estimator. Keep travel as pass-through and include the light success measures. Remove all **\[OWL note\]** callouts before sending.

* **For a contract / SOW (with or without a PO):** Make a copy and then convert the “Investment” and “Timeline & milestones” into a numbered SOW with invoice triggers (deposit \+ milestone billing). Update the terms as follows:   
  * Mirror the final negotiated terms (e.g. deposit vs. Net-30, early-pay, pause-at-+15) exactly as approved by the district/AP.  
  * Keep Ops & Compliance (2–3%) on services and travel at cost (no markup); if the district won’t accept the fee, adjust scope/rate to maintain margin, or document an approved exception.  
  * Add standard compliance lines (COI, background checks, onsite protocols) and a brief change-order/cancellation clause.  
  * Include signature blocks and a field for PO \# when applicable.

* **For public-sector exceptions:** If deposits or Net-15 aren’t allowed, set Net-30 with clear milestone dates and re-check pricing in the Estimator so contribution margin remains ≥45%.

Note: While this appendix serves as the default client-facing template, the OWL Estimator Tool remains the benchmark for all pricing, margin checks, and terms. You can find more information about the Estimator [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1L0aIw164KiBpfw4cS8R2RMV0EsCW7P-nS4IWOrmKow4/edit).

##### Purpose

Students learn deepest when school connects to who they are and what their community needs. Together, THSD and OWL will co-design experiences that build belonging, student agency, and real-world relevance \- while giving your team practical tools they can use the next day.

##### What you can expect

* Co-created sessions tailored to your teachers, students, and context  
* Simple cycles of “try it, study it, improve it” to build momentum  
* Artifacts you can share with families, leaders, and the board

**\[OWL note: This section replaces jargon like “PDSA” with plain language. Keep it 3–5 bullets max.\]**

##### Scope & Deliverables Overview

**In-person facilitation:** **\[X\]** days  
**Virtual support:** **\[Y\]** sessions (≤4 hrs each)  
**Focus areas:** e.g., student-centered lesson redesign, performance assessments, community-connected projects, classroom culture & routines that foster safety and belonging

**Deliverables**

* Co-designed agendas, slide decks, and classroom protocols  
* A short “next steps” plan after each session (who will try what, by when, and how we’ll check on it)  
* Two short stories of practice (“what changed and why it matters”) with quick evidence

**Cadence**

* Brief planning touchpoint before each session  
* Quick debrief after each on-site day  
* A simple midpoint check-in to tune the plan

**\[OWL note: If your scope uses multiple schools/teams, add a 1-paragraph “By Site” sublist with dates or windows. The following are other format considerations that can be used with or in lieu of the above\]**

| Phase | Key Activities | Expected Outcomes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Phase 1: Discovery & Vision | Visioning sessions, empathy-centered design activities | Shared instructional vision, aligned leadership priorities |
| Phase 2: Design & Development | Onsite workshops, professional learning, co-design days | Teacher-developed tools, inquiry-based strategies |

| **Total Estimate** |  | **$8,610** |

*OWL is committed to ensuring pricing is not a barrier to equitable partnership. We welcome adjustments based on mutual agreement.*

##### Partner Responsibilities (How we’ll work together)

* **THSD** provides a primary contact, confirms participants and rooms, and shares any required onboarding steps (badges, background checks, visitor protocols, etc.).  
* **OWL** provides a project lead (your day-to-day contact) and facilitators, coordinates logistics, and ensures the work stays on time and aligned to outcomes.

**\[OWL note: This section aligns with the Program Manager (PM) accountability items found in the OWL Client Engagement Playbook.\]**

##### Terms of Agreement 

**Payment terms (district-friendly)**

* **Deposit:** **40–50%** at acceptance (if your policies prohibit deposits, we’ll align with Net-30 and set milestone dates accordingly)  
* **Invoices:** after each milestone/session (services), and for travel at cost  
* **Preferred:** Net-15 with ACH (2% early-pay discount if paid within 5 days). Note: If your AP requires Net-30 or different language, we’ll match your standard terms in the SOW  
* **Past-due:** Services pause at 15+ days past invoice until payment is current.

**Scheduling & changes:** We’ll hold dates once the agreement is signed. If dates shift, we’ll reschedule as close as possible and update the plan by email.

**Compliance & site access:** OWL will provide certificates of insurance and complete any required background checks or onboarding steps at least 30 days prior to service.

**Confidentiality:** OWL will take reasonable care to protect information marked confidential. Exemptions include prior knowledge, public information, or lawful third-party disclosures.

**Termination:** Either party may terminate with 7 days' notice. Client agrees to pay for services rendered up to termination.

##### The OWL Team

OWL brings together a team of experienced educators and facilitators with a proven track record in supporting learner-centered innovation. For this engagement, we propose the following team members:

* **George P. Burdell – OWL Fellow & Consultant**  
  A veteran middle school science teacher with 15 years of experience in interdisciplinary STEM, inquiry-based learning, and teacher leadership. George is a founding OWL Fellow and frequent workshop facilitator.  
* **Ernest Rutherford – OWL Senior Facilitator & Design Coach**  
  A former National Faculty member with PBLWorks, Ernest has supported instructional redesign in over 20 districts. With a background in physics and systems thinking, he guides both technical and adaptive leadership efforts.

*Additional OWL Fellows may be included to meet the unique needs of each project phase.*

##### Optional Attachment 1: About Open Way Learning 

![][image3]

Open Way Learning (OWL) is a 501(c)(3) education nonprofit with a relentless focus on helping schools develop, sustain, and scale cultures of learner-centered innovation. Our mission is to co-design ways to amplify the joy and wonder of learning for every student, especially those historically furthest from opportunity. Our vision is that all learners can change their world \- and innovative schools can empower that change to happen now.

What makes OWL unique is our open-source approach. We use Design Thinking to amplify local ideas and co-create hyper-customized solutions rather than prescribe one-size-fits-all programs. Everything we create \- tools, processes, resources \- is shared openly so others can adapt and scale what works.

### **What recent partners say**

*“Each session felt tailored to our teachers. We left with tools we could use the next day with students.”*

**\[OWL note: Drop in two short quotes; keep names/titles with permission.\]**

# Learn more at [www.openwaylearning.org](http://www.openwaylearning.org)

##### Optional Attachment 2: Success Metrics & Reporting (adapt as needed)

**Measures of Success:**

* Teachers try one or two new routines or project structures and keep what works  
* Students see clearer purpose in their work and can explain what they’re learning and why  
* School teams leave with reusable tools and a short list of “what we’ll spread next”

**\[OWL note: Keep this section simple and specific to the clear outcomes we wish to track over the course of the service engagement, ideally aligned to the PDSA process. The following is another format that can be considered.\]**

| Monitoring Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monthly Invoicing & Service Logs | Monthly | Transparency and fiscal accountability |
| Check-ins with Project Liaison | Monthly | Review progress, adapt plan as needed |
| Final Summary Report | December 2025 | Document key outcomes, reflections, and artifacts |

**Key Indicators of Success:**

* Teacher engagement in inquiry and PBL practices  
* Clear implementation of the co-designed instructional vision  
* Staff and student feedback showing relevance and value  
* Observable instructional shifts aligned with stated goals

##### Optional Attachment 3: OWL’s Value-Added Approach to Professional Learning (adapt as needed)

OWL doesn't deliver professional development  \-  we co-create transformation.

Our work is rooted in Design Thinking, not as a buzzword, but as a way to truly listen, empathize, and prototype change that fits each school’s unique reality. Every engagement starts with a simple question: *What does success look like and how can we work with your team to create the conditions to bring that success to reality?*

We don’t show up with a slide deck of pre-baked content. We show up ready to help teams:

* Identify barriers to meaningful learning.  
* Prototype solutions that make sense in *your* context.  
* Implement and iterate on real strategies in real classrooms.

This approach means no two sessions are ever the same, because no two schools are the same. That’s how we make professional learning feel like learning, not training. It’s also why educators leave our sessions not just inspired, but with something *concrete in hand* they can immediately put to use in their own schools and classrooms.

##### Optional Attachment 4: OWL’s Facilitator Commitments (adapt as needed)

OWL facilitators are more than PD providers. We are learning partners committed to creating the conditions for learner-centered innovations to stick.

Here’s what we commit to every time we walk into a school or Zoom room:

* Clarity over complexity – We explain things simply, and help others do the same.  
* Doing, not just talking – Sessions are active, inquiry-based, and modeled on how authentic, deep learning feels.  
* Real-time responsiveness – We constantly adapt to the just-in-time needs of participants, based on what we see, hear, and feel in the room.  
* A “Show, Don’t Tell” approach that means less “sit and get” and more active co-design and co-creation of the tools and strategies they’ll use and improve.  
* Follow-through matters – We don’t disappear after the workshop. Our model includes coaching, iteration, and embedded feedback loops that drive continuous improvement.

Above all, we model joyful, learner-centered facilitation because we know the only way to create that kind of culture for students is for adults to experience it firsthand.

##### Optional Attachment 5: Sample PD Session Objectives & Differentiation Examples (adapt as needed)

We’re often asked: “What exactly do your sessions look like?” The truth is, no two are the same. But all of them share a few things in common:

* They’re designed with teachers, not just for them.  
* They build on what’s already working  \-  the “bright spots” in a school’s practice.  
* They shrink the change into something educators can act on right away.  
* And they always result in a concrete product, ready to be tested, improved, and shared.

Here are just a few ways that plays out:

* Unit / Lesson / Project Hacks with Design Thinking: We help teachers take what they already do and make it more powerful, shifting traditional lessons into experiences that invite inquiry, reflection, and real-world relevance. Using the Design Thinking process, we guide teams through fast, focused sprints to rework existing units so students are solving problems that matter to them.  
* Collaborative Planning Support: Rather than hand off a new planning tool, we model how to use it together. These sessions build collective teacher efficacy by embedding team-based routines for unit design, formative assessment, and reflection, often modeling thinking routines and protocols co-created by OWL and the school. It’s not “just another meeting.” It’s where strategy becomes practice.  
* Centering Student Voice: We support school teams in conducting empathy interviews, focus groups, and student-led feedback sessions. The goal? To listen deeply to what students say, think, do, and feel about their learning experience and then use that as insight to co-create a collective vision that puts authentic learning at the center of instructional design and school culture.

Also note that every session ends with a usable prototype  \-  a lesson plan, planning protocol, assessment tool, etc. built by teachers, for teachers and presented for peer input as a way to model a culture of openness, trust, and continuous improvement. That’s what makes it stick.

##### Optional Attachment 6: Example of OWL’s Work 

#### **Building & Scaling Summer STEAM**

Since April 2023, OWL has partnered with Albuquerque Public Schools to spark a district-wide shift toward experiential, community-connected learning. What began as a pilot for a middle school STEAM summer program has grown into a vibrant, educator-led movement, with interdisciplinary, design-based learning experiences now embedded across [APS Summer STEAM offerings](https://www.aps.edu/news/news-from-2024-2025/aps-middle-schoolers-go-on-steam-summer-adventures).

The results speak for themselves: student presentations have reached a level of quality and relevance that rivals traditional senior capstone projects. This kind of student empowerment has inspired teachers to step beyond their comfort zones, take on leadership roles, and advocate for continuing and expanding the work. As one leader noted, *“It’s the first time I’ve seen this many teachers this excited about PD  \-  and even more excited about what their students are creating.”*
