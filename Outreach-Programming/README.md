> This README is a high-level overview for fast reference.

> Any policy/guardrail changes must be approved via #decision_log and reflected in the Drive doc, then mirrored here.

## Purpose (what this role exists to achieve)
Design and deliver consistently excellent, learner-centered programs—and turn that delivery into **evidence and visibility** that sustain OWL’s mission (artifacts, stories, renewals, and reputation).

## What success looks like (core outcomes)
- **Program quality at scale:** Sessions/workshops delivered to scope, on time, with strong partner feedback.
- **Evidence engine:** Regular **Bright Spots** and **Proof Points** published; clean data flow for evaluation and storytelling.
- **Visibility that fits:** Public campaigns and comms that are mission-aligned, accurate, and timely—supporting renewal and pipeline growth.
- **Safe and compliant practice:** Safeguarding, consent, and brand/compliance standards upheld across sites and artifacts.

## Decision rights & guardrails (snapshot)
- **One “A” rule:** DPIV is **Accountable** for public-facing campaigns/announcements and program visibility decisions; **Consulted** = D-OSL (strategic frame), DFO (brand/compliance).
- **ROI Guardrail:** If visibility or events imply delivery scope/cost, they must meet guardrails (**deposit in hand**, **≥minimum margin**, **pass-throughs matched**, **or** funded path ≤90 days) or be logged as a strategic exception.
- **Logging:** Post Strategic/Tactical outcomes in **#decision_log** (3–5 lines: summary, RACI-S, why it matters, next step, link).

## Scope of work (high-signal summary)
- **Program design & delivery:** Standards for facilitation/co-design; session architecture; coaching practices; QA for slides/tools.
- **Impact measurement & artifacts:** Define metrics with D-OSL; collect evidence; publish **Bright Spots/Proof Points** on cadence.
- **Public comms & campaigns:** Message maps, channel calendar, asset library; coordinate announcements and event visibility.
- **Events & convenings:** Agenda design, run-of-show, partner experience; coordinate with DFIO on budget/logistics.
- **Safeguarding & compliance:** Consent/FERPA/PII standards for images, stories, and data; brand usage and approvals.

## Interfaces (who you co-design with)
- **DFIO — Finance & Internal Ops:** Event budgets/logistics; brand/compliance; asset management; data/privacy alignment.
- **D-OSL — Strategy & Learning:** Theory of change; artifact standards; adoption of program/process updates.
- **PMs & Fellows — Site Delivery:** Local co-design, implementation quality, feedback capture, artifact generation.

## KPIs & review cadence
- **Weekly:** KPI flash (delivery on-time/scope, partner signals); Grants & Partnerships slot; blockers/swarms; decisions to log.
- **Monthly:** Artifact production count; campaign/event impact snapshot (reach, engagement, leads); budget vs. plan for events/comms.
- **Quarterly:** Program impact synthesis (top insights), evidence roll-up, contribution to renewals/pipeline.

## Operating discipline (always)
Use Slack for essential comms; keep Productive cards current; maintain file/asset hygiene with links back to artifacts; adhere to consent/brand standards; status format: **Here’s where we are → Here’s the gap → Here’s the next step.**

## Director-as-PM expectation (when applicable)
When serving as PM, **earn your keep**: cover salary (and attributable overhead) **monthly** through billable service and/or funded grants/contracts within your portfolio.

## RACI-S snapshot (common calls)
- **Public Campaign/Announcement:** **A = DPIV**, C = D-OSL/DPD/DFIO, I = Team.
- **Event/Summit (program-led):** **A = DPIV**, R = DPIV/PM, C = DFIO (budget/logistics), DPD (sponsors), I = Team/partners.
- **Crisis Comms:** **A = DPIV**, C = D-OSL (strategy), DFIO (risk/compliance), I = Board/Team as needed.
