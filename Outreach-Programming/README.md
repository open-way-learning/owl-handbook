This section includes policies and expectations for OWL’s client-facing work. It covers workshop design, facilitation standards, client co-design practices, service delivery protocols, and feedback collection processes.

This section is actively maintained by the **Director of Outreach & Programming**, who serves as the content steward for all files in this folder. Any proposed changes should be coordinated with this Director for alignment, accuracy, and final approval.
