# Outreach & Programming

{% hint style="info" %}
**Owner:** Director of Program Impact & Visibility (DPIV) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff, contractors, and Fellows
{% endhint %}

This section gathers the core documents that shape how OWL shows up in the field with schools, districts, and networks - from a single workshop to multi-year, regional initiatives - as well as how we document and share the impact of that work through stories, artifacts, metrics, and evidence.

The DPIV is responsible for maintaining these documents, with changes coordinated through OWL’s collective leadership and decision-making processes. As new tools for improved programs, facilitation, storytelling, and measurement are developed, they will be added here.

## What you’ll find in this section

**OWL Client Engagement Playbook**  
  Plain-language guide for how OWL designs, scopes, stewards, and renews external engagements. Covers our engagement principles, phases of work (Discovery → Co-Design → Agreement → Launch → PDSA → Reflection/Renewal), expectations for the Program Manager/Secondary Contact, and how we align scoping and delivery with our open-source, learner-centered values.

**Rethinking Measures of Success**  
  OWL’s detailed approach to measuring impact with partners. Describes our philosophy for blending process and outcome data, aligning metrics to deeper learning and equity, and using PDSA cycles to study change over time. Includes examples of Bright Spots/Proof Points, guidance for counting schools/educators/students served, and how we track pro bono work.

## How to use this section

- When planning or leading any client-facing work (from a one-off workshop to a complex initiative), **start with the Client Engagement Playbook** to ground your approach in OWL’s shared engagement rhythm and expectations.  
- When designing impact measures, writing reports, or crafting stories of practice, **use Rethinking Measures of Success** to align your metrics, artifacts, and narratives with OWL’s evidence framework.  
- For questions about scoping, PDSA rhythms, or how stories of impact feed into visibility and renewal, **begin here**, then connect with the DPIV (and DFO/other Directors as needed) for context-specific decisions.

As OWL's portfolio grows, this folder will remain the home for concise, field-facing guides that help us deliver excellent programming and tell clear, credible stories of impact.
