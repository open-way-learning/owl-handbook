## **OWL’s Approach to Measuring What Matters**

At Open Way Learning, we believe schools thrive when students are empowered to engage deeply, think critically, and apply their learning in meaningful ways. Our method for measuring impact goes beyond traditional test scores to include multiple forms of growth—academic, behavioral, social-emotional, and real-world readiness.

### **Why We Rethink Data**

Traditional metrics often fall short in capturing the complexity of learning. Test prep strategies, while well-intentioned, may improve surface-level performance without addressing deeper learning needs. OWL helps schools build the conditions under which lasting academic and personal success are more likely—conditions grounded in trust, agency, relevance, and high expectations.

Our approach draws on leading research from:

* [Harvard’s DataWise](https://datawise.gse.harvard.edu/) (collaborative data inquiry),  
* [Carnegie Foundation](https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/improvement-in-education/six-core-principles-improvement/) (Improvement Science),  
* [Hattie’s Visible Learning](https://visible-learning.org/) (collective efficacy, student voice),  
* [Lucas Education Research](https://www.lucasedresearch.org/research/research-briefs/) (evidence-based impacts of Project-Based Learning),  
* and frameworks for Deeper Learning and Social-Emotional Development.

### **A Clear, Research-Based Framework**

We use a simple, methodical framework built around four core questions:

* What does success look like—for students and systems?  
* Are we doing what we said we would do? *(Process)*  
* Are we doing it well? *(Driver-level quality)*  
* Is it producing the outcomes we want? *(Impact)*

We support schools in designing local tools—rubrics, student surveys, exhibitions, portfolios—and in using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to test and refine their strategies in real time.

### **Evidence from OWL-Supported Schools**

Across a range of school contexts, OWL-supported practices have yielded significant student growth (see table below).

These results demonstrate that learner-centered innovation can—and does—strengthen traditional outcomes when paired with strong process design and educator support.

Rather than treat improvement as a checklist, OWL helps schools build a culture of continuous learning—where students and educators co-design solutions, reflect on data, and scale what works. This culture change is what drives sustainable transformation.
