**OWL Partner Integration Playbook**

***General Framework for Partner Roles and Collaboration Across OWL Initiatives & Projects***

## **Overview**

This internal playbook outlines how Open Way Learning (OWL) approaches partner integration across all its initiatives. As a nonprofit grounded in open-source values and co-design principles, OWL views collaboration as essential to advancing sustainable culture change in education.

Every OWL initiative is driven by a flexible but principled structure that:

* Prioritizes local leadership and trust-building;  
* Aligns partners around a learner-centered, equity-driven vision;  
* Matches contributions to school and district needs;  
* Protects transparency, mission alignment, and impact integrity.

This playbook reflects OWL's smart growth approach and aligns with the beliefs and structures described in our guiding document: **"Our Approach: The What & How."**

## **Core Principles for Partnership**

1. **Co-Design is Non-Negotiable** – All partners, no matter their role, must engage with humility and flexibility to design with—not for—communities.  
2. **One Size Never Fits All** – School and district contexts determine which partners play what role, and when. OWL ensures all work is customized and responsive.  
3. **Mission Integrity First** – Our nonprofit status, learner-centered vision, and equity commitments always take precedence over visibility, scale, or influence.  
4. **Mutual Benefit & Transparency** – Every partner should clearly understand their “gives and gets” in the initiative—and share that openly.

## **Partner Structure**

OWL organizes partners into three clear tiers:

1. ### **Primary Partners (Co-Leads)**

   These organizations share ownership over initiative design, facilitation, and deliverables. They co-steward grants, coordinate communications, and hold responsibility for quality and alignment.  
   * Responsibilities include: strategic planning, school onboarding, backbone support, facilitation, coaching, documentation, and public representation.

2. ### **Tactical Collaborators (Implementation-Aligned)**

   These organizations bring specialized expertise (e.g., policy, mental health, technical assistance) and are matched to schools based on need and interest. They operate under shared protocols and communication norms.  
   * Responsibilities include: workshop facilitation, local coaching, resource provision, evaluation, or technical assistance—always in collaboration with OWL and/or the primary partners.

3. ### **Strategic Advisory Board (Critical Friends & Amplifiers)**

   A diverse group of thought leaders, policy advisors, and field experts who:  
* Provide insight on equity, strategy, and sustainability;  
* Help connect the initiative to national and state policy movements;  
* Offer external validation and advocacy support.

## **Key Guardrails for All OWL Partnerships**

| Guardrail | Explanation |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Mission Alignment** | All partners must share OWL’s learner-centered, equity-driven values and approach. |
| **Nonprofit-Led Structure** | Initiative design and decisions rest with OWL and primary partners. Collaborators contribute within agreed scopes. |
| **Transparency with Schools** | School contacts, contributions, and communications are tracked and co-managed under unified protocols. |
| **Role-Specific Branding** | Public materials must reflect distributed leadership and avoid presenting collaborators as lead entities. |
| **Documentation of Scope** | All partners define their contributions in writing, using the "Gives & Gets" framework (see Appendix A). |

## **Partner Onboarding Flow**

1. **Initial Conversation** – Discuss alignment, capacity, and potential fit across one or more OWL initiatives.  
2. **Framing Document** – Provide this playbook and OWL’s "Our Approach" doc to set shared expectations.  
3. **Gives & Gets Matrix** – Partner completes or co-constructs a scope of work identifying contributions, outcomes, and boundaries.  
4. **Agreement or MOU** – Finalize roles in writing, including payment terms (if applicable), IP, and timeline.  
5. **Ongoing Communication** – Join initiative-specific calls, advisory meetings, or regional events as agreed.

## **Appendix A: Partner "Gives & Gets" Matrix (Template)**

| Partner | Gives (Contribution) | Gets (Benefits) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **\[Partner Name\]** | \- \[e.g., Trauma-informed PD, leadership coaching\]- \[e.g., Outreach to regional districts\]- \[e.g., Research, data strategy\] | \- Visibility as a key contributor- Connection to statewide efforts- Access to learning network and tools |
| **Open Way Learning** | \- Project facilitation, coaching, and design support- Strategic coordination- Storytelling and communication infrastructure | \- Expanded reach and impact- Strategic partnerships- Field learning and long-term sustainability |
| **\[Other Primary Partner\]** | \- \[e.g., Networked improvement coaching, SEL design support\]- \[e.g., Convening facilitation\] | \- Continued leadership presence- Co-ownership of outcomes and storytelling |

*Customize the matrix for each initiative. Use it to manage expectations, scopes, and communication with every partner.*

*This document will be adapted per project and revisited regularly to ensure it continues to reflect OWL’s values and the shared commitments of all coalition partners.*
