**Audience:** All OWL staff and contractors/Fellows
{% endhint %}

Open Way Learning (OWL) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing learner-centered innovation in education. To support this mission, OWL partners with highly qualified individuals \- referred to as OWL Fellows \- who deliver professional development, workshops, coaching, and related services to schools and education organizations across the United States.

This manual outlines the expectations, responsibilities, and best practices for individuals working with OWL as independent contractors, including those recognized as OWL Fellows. It is organized to include key reference sections such as the OWL Independent Contractor Payment Terms and to cross-reference the OWL Code of Ethics, which is provided separately for review and signature. Contractors should review this full manual, including the Payment Terms section, before accepting any contracted work. The most current version of this manual is maintained in OWL’s documentation hub (currently GitBook); electronic links shared during onboarding always point to the latest version.

## **1 \- OWL Fellow Status & Contractor Relationship**

OWL Fellows are highly qualified professionals engaged by OWL as independent contractors. They support OWL’s mission through services such as professional development, workshops, coaching, and strategic facilitation. As independent contractors:

* Fellows work under a signed [ICA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jcpmY8hDsiDyTqlCmG5KEyQHonmXM14fsKKIlSDBkbI/edit?usp=sharing).  
* They are not OWL employees and do not receive employee benefits or equipment.  
* They are responsible for their own tax reporting, business registration, and insurance.  
* They are not guaranteed work and may accept or decline engagements based on alignment, availability, and need.  
* They retain the right to work with other clients or organizations outside of OWL.

All contracted services must be detailed in a signed Scope of Work (SOW) and accepted in writing prior to delivery.

### **1.1 Contractor Boundaries and Access**

To remain in compliance with IRS and labor regulations, OWL maintains a clear distinction between contractors and employees. As such:

* Fellows do **not** receive OWL email accounts or access to internal platforms (e.g., Slack, team Productive boards).  
* OWL may grant limited access to certain systems (e.g., Productive, Mural, etc.) strictly for administrative purposes such as viewing schedules or submitting invoices. *Note: Limited system access is offered only for administrative convenience and will not be used for monitoring, supervision, or day-to-day task direction.*  
* All planning and communication will occur through designated OWL staff via email or shared documents connected to an approved Scope of Work.  
* Fellows are expected to use their own tools for scheduling, billing, and documentation unless otherwise agreed upon.

**Role limits and staffing decisions**  
Contractors cannot serve in ongoing employee-like roles (for example, internal project management with day-to-day supervision, fixed schedules, or core operational responsibilities that extend over multiple months). Such ongoing work must be assigned to OWL employees (hourly, part-time, or full-time). Contractor engagements are deliverable-based and governed by a signed Scope of Work (SOW). For guidance on when to staff work with an OWL employee versus a contractor or OWL Fellow, see Appendix D: OWL Contractor Staffing Decision Tree.

These boundaries protect both the legal standing of the contractor relationship and the operational integrity of OWL’s nonprofit structure.

### **1.2 Professional Expectations**

OWL Fellows are expected to:

* Represent OWL in alignment with its mission, vision, values, and Code of Ethics.  
* Deliver high-quality, learner-centered facilitation based on adult learning best practices.  
* Communicate professionally and meet all deadlines and deliverables.  
* Comply with the [OWL Travel Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1_lvw8vxFSF2Qf0LbIIPfAN4ur2GNZEkgTKLCkuOhJ0o/edit) for reimbursable expenses*.  
* Maintain ethical conduct and respect the communities and schools they serve.

* *Default to virtual-first service delivery whenever feasible, with travel only when it is clearly needed for impact and has been pre-approved and funded in alignment with the OWL Travel Policy.


Fellows are encouraged to:

* Use the OWL Competency Framework for ongoing reflection and growth.  
* Share tools, strategies, and adaptations in alignment with OWL’s open-source philosophy.  
* Engage in continuous improvement through feedback and professional collaboration.

### **1.3 Code of Ethics Acknowledgment**

As a condition of service, OWL Fellows agree to abide by OWL’s Code of Ethics while performing services under any approved Scope of Work. This includes a commitment to equity, transparency, inclusion, and learner-centered practices. Signing the Code of Ethics affirms this shared responsibility—without implying an employment relationship.

### **1.4 Non-Solicitation & Non-Compete Policy**

To protect the integrity of OWL’s partnerships and client trust:

* Fellows may not solicit or provide similar services to OWL clients outside of an OWL contract for 12 months following their most recent engagement with that client.  
* During their time as a contractor and for one year thereafter, Fellows agree not to engage in or solicit directly competitive services to any OWL client they served through OWL.   
* “Similar work” includes services aligned with OWL’s core offerings, such as learner-centered design, innovation strategy, and facilitation of experiential learning models.  
* This clause does not restrict Fellows from accepting unrelated work or engagements with clients not associated with OWL.  
* Exceptions to this policy may be approved in writing by OWL leadership in advance (e.g. for joint grant-funded work or multi-organization partnerships, etc.).

### **1.5 Grounds for Removal from the OWL Contractor Pool**

OWL reserves the right to pause or discontinue future engagements with a Fellow at any time, particularly in cases of:

* Repeated substandard performance or missed deliverables  
* Breach of contract or professional ethics  
* Harassment, discrimination, or retaliation  
* Failure to follow client or OWL safety protocols  
* Unauthorized sharing of confidential or proprietary information

To remain in good standing, Fellows must also:

* Facilitate at least one OWL engagement per year unless otherwise approved.  
* Submit required background checks or insurance documentation when requested.  
* Use their own laptops, devices, and materials unless otherwise specified.  
* Not represent themselves as employees or use OWL branding on external proposals, social media, or communications without prior approval.

## **2 \- OWL Fellow Onboarding Guideline:**

The following guideline ensures that highly qualified educators joining OWL’s contractor pool as OWL Fellows are equipped to deliver exceptional, learner-centered services aligned with OWL’s mission, values, and legal structure. This guide provides a flexible but structured pathway grounded in OWL’s core competencies and open-source approach, while maintaining full IRS compliance for independent contractors.

As part of this onboarding process, all OWL Fellow candidates participate in a probationary orientation period of up to six months designed to ensure the candidate can meet the quality, professionalism, and mission-aligned expectations required for client-facing work with OWL. This process is not considered employee training and complies with IRS standards for independent contractors. Fellows must sign the OWL Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) and the Code of Ethics prior to participating in any billable services.

### **2.0 Phase 0: Pre-Engagement**

This initial phase is designed to explore mutual alignment between the candidate and OWL’s mission, values, and expectations for independent contractors. It allows OWL to learn more about the candidate’s strengths, areas for growth, and potential contributions, while also giving the candidate a clear introduction to OWL’s learner-centered approach and independent contractor structure. This phase also launches the self-assessment process using the OWL Competency Framework.

**Key Steps:**

* **Application:** Candidates who are already in the OWL Ambassador network or are referred from trusted partners invited to review the [OWL Fellow program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Uz3UyGWGdRCYMa9po3k6CvrNkWUAAbQg-dfNeP4cdo/edit?usp=sharing) in detail and then, if they wish, [apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLXGHRrhk-QPciaTkjFyMmtw501IB53OKD5c1A2h3Ax1zZVQ/viewform) to be an OWL Fellow. 

* **Introductory Review:** An OWL Director or designated Fellow Manager will initiate an initial conversation that includes discussion of:  
  * Personal strengths and growth areas  
  * Alignment to OWL’s mission and learner-centered philosophy  
  * Availability and project preferences  
  * Understanding of independent contractor expectations

* **Self-Evaluation:** Candidates complete the [OWL Fellow Competency Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rg71iPSMcGAzsW2HSWTBKtrEfav_gNqxXcck60JcyaI/edit?usp=sharing), a reflective tool that informs both their personal development and initial Tier placement within OWL’s compensation framework.

***Note:** OWL encourages all prospective contractors to consult with a tax or legal advisor to fully understand the responsibilities associated with independent contractor status.*

### **2.1 Phase 1: Welcome & Alignment**

In this phase, candidates are formally welcomed into the OWL onboarding process and provided with essential tools, expectations, and philosophical grounding to prepare them for client-facing work. Candidates review key documents, complete necessary forms, and submit a sample professional learning design to demonstrate their understanding of OWL’s values, facilitation standards, and learner-centered approach.

***Note:** Completion of this phase does not confer full OWL Fellow status. Candidates are not officially considered OWL Fellows until they successfully complete Phases 1–3 and are invited into the active contractor pool.*

**What Candidates Will Receive:**

* Welcome message acknowledging their selection as an official OWL Fellow Candidate  
* Onboarding materials, including:  
  * OWL Contractor Manual  
  * Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA)  
  * W-9 form and optional Direct Deposit Authorization  
  * [OWL Code of Ethics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T66L04KpI_RClUVb83j-jKVXAxadS2aw7Nm8CkEsSa0/edit?usp=sharing)  
  * [OWL Fellow Competency Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rg71iPSMcGAzsW2HSWTBKtrEfav_gNqxXcck60JcyaI/edit?usp=sharing)  
  * [Invoice Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_pHcdQ-ISu2A58pzKK-nfo9sPKoFsFU0f1fLwtqmpTs/edit?usp=sharing) and Sample Scope of Work (SOW)  
  * “[About OWL – The What & How](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/149ZsxLJROMyFI7njaNLz9ECnqeLxKUG1qnqoEryrVXY/edit?usp=sharing)” overview

**Key Deliverables:**

- [ ] Review OWL’s mission, values, and “What & How” document to understand OWL’s approach to co-design, client partnerships, and experiential learning.  
- [ ] Sign and submit all required documents (ICA, W-9, Code of Ethics, etc.).  
- [ ] Submit a mock slide deck and agenda for a 2-hour professional development session to demonstrate facilitation skills aligned with OWL’s Competency Framework.

***Reminder:** OWL contractors are issued a 1099 form annually for tax reporting purposes. By submitting a W-9, the contractor acknowledges their responsibility for all applicable tax obligations.*

### **2.2 Phase 2: Workshop Observation**

This phase provides candidates with a firsthand experience of OWL’s facilitation style, team dynamics, and approach to learner-centered client engagement. By observing an OWL-facilitated session, candidates deepen their understanding of quality expectations, cultural alignment, and service delivery standards. A structured debrief helps assess readiness for the next phase of co-facilitation.

**Core Activities:**

* **Shadow an OWL Workshop:** Observe a half- or full-day OWL-led engagement to gain insight into facilitation strategies, client culture, and participant interaction. *Note:  Travel expenses are reimbursed; however, observation time is not compensated.*  
* **Debrief with OWL Lead:** Meet with the OWL Fellow Manager or lead facilitator to reflect on the experience, discuss key takeaways, and assess preparedness for future co-facilitation. Topics include professionalism, preparation, and alignment with OWL values and competencies.

### **2.3 Phase 3: Co-Facilitation & Reflection**

In this final onboarding phase, candidates engage in hands-on delivery of OWL services, co-facilitating alongside experienced OWL staff. This phase provides authentic opportunities to demonstrate professional judgment, high-quality facilitation, and alignment with OWL’s core competencies. Successful completion of this phase marks the candidate’s formal transition to full OWL Fellow status.

**Core Activities:**

* **Hands-on Facilitation:** Participate in at least two co-facilitated OWL engagements with an OWL team member.   
* *Note: During this phase, all Fellow Candidates are compensated at the base contractor rate for all facilitation work performed.*

**Key Deliverables:**

- [ ] Submit a brief reflection after each co-facilitated session, documenting key takeaways, facilitation strengths, and growth areas.  
- [ ] Participate in both a midpoint and final debrief with the OWL Fellow Manager or lead facilitator to reflect on progress and readiness for independent service delivery.

### **2.4 Phase 4: Official Fellow Status**

After successful completion of Phases 1–3 described above, the candidate is formally designated as an OWL Fellow and becomes eligible to provide paid, client-facing services as an independent contractor on behalf of Open Way Learning. All contracted work is assigned on a case-by-case basis, based on alignment between client needs and the Fellow’s demonstrated expertise, geographic location, prior experience with the client, and availability.

As a new OWL Fellow, they will receive a customized Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) that includes an assigned Tier (1–4), based on experience and demonstrated competencies (see Section 4 of this manual – Contractor Compensation Guidelines / Payment Terms – for details on tiers and rates). Fellows may also be invited to participate in OWL retreats, professional learning experiences, co-author blogs and resources, attend or present at conferences, and contribute to curriculum design efforts.

**Important Reminders:**

* OWL Fellows are not employees and will be compensated as independent contractors on a per-project basis under a 1099 structure.  
* OWL Fellows are not guaranteed work or contracts.  
* All contracted work must be formally accepted in writing through a signed Scope of Work.  
* Fellows have the right to decline a Scope of Work; however, repeated rejections may affect future invitations.  
* OWL Fellows may be reviewed annually based on client and peer feedback, quality of facilitation, and alignment with OWL’s Competency Framework.  
* OWL reserves the right to remove a Fellow from the active contractor pool at any time if expectations outlined in the ICA are not met.  
* To maintain active status, Fellows must facilitate at least one engagement per year.

## **3 \- Scope of Work (SOW) & Service Workflow**

### **3.0 Contractor Scope of Work**

All services performed by OWL Fellows must be detailed in an approved Contractor Scope of Work (SOW). The SOW serves as an official addendum to the Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) and ensures legal clarity, proper alignment with client needs, and scope-specific expectations for both OWL and the contractor. Each SOW must include:

* A description of the services to be performed.  
* Delivery format (onsite, hybrid, or virtual).  
* Service location and key OWL/client contacts.  
* Timeframe and anticipated duration of the work.  
* Specific deliverables (e.g., planning sessions, PD workshops, coaching).  
* Compensation terms, including rate, estimated hours, and pre-approved travel/reimbursement guidelines.

**Acceptance Requirement:** Contractors must accept the SOW in writing—typically via email reply—within 72 hours of receiving it. If service dates need to shift, adjustments may be made via email so long as the nature or scope of the work does not materially change.

**Assignment Considerations:** OWL assigns work based on client requests, the Fellow’s skill set, prior experience, availability, geographic proximity, and expressed preferences. Fellows are never obligated to accept a given assignment but should understand that repeated rejections may reduce future invitations.

**Staffing decisions and this manual**  
This section assumes that OWL has already decided to staff the work with a contractor or OWL Fellow rather than a salaried employee. Directors and Project Managers should use Appendix D: OWL Contractor Staffing Decision Tree to make that staffing decision first, then return to this section to shape the contractor’s Scope of Work (SOW) in alignment with OWL’s policies, expectations, and financial guardrails.

### **3.1 Service Workflow**

The following stages outline the life cycle of a typical OWL engagement:

#### **3.1.0 Stage 0: Contractor Onboarding**

Prior to receiving any assignments, each Fellow must complete onboarding (see the OWL Fellow Onboarding section above).

* Signed Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA), W-9, and Direct Deposit Authorization Form (optional).  
* Signed OWL Code of Ethics.  
* Receipt of the OWL Contractor Manual (including the Payment Terms section) and templates for invoices and Scope of Work.  
* Familiarity with [Technology Requirements for all OWL Remote Services](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmo0r91eTfCqw-s4AruyII8qJslXHQQLubhPnqW54HM/edit?usp=sharing) and professional expectations.

#### **3.1.1 Stage 1: Service Engagement Initiation**

When a service is anticipated:

* An OWL Program Manager will contact the Fellow to gauge availability.  
* A brief overview of the engagement and a copy of the client MOU or contract will be shared.  
* If available, the Fellow will receive a formal SOW, including:  
  * Deliverables and expectations.  
  * Format and location of the service.  
  * Target dates and timelines.  
  * Compensation, travel, and planning hour limits.  
* For external engagements, OWL will not send you into the field “contract-blind.” For each project, there must be:  
  * a binding client instrument (such as a fully executed OWL or client-provided agreement, a client-issued purchase order that references our proposal/scope, or a written acceptance of an OWL proposal that explicitly confirms scope and budget), and  
  * a brief OWL Scope of Work (SOW) that clarifies your role, dates, deliverables, and invoicing assumptions.

  Your OWL Program Manager (PM) is responsible for sharing this SOW before or at the start of service delivery and updating you if the client requests changes.

Dates in the SOW are generally considered flexible unless noted otherwise. Any adjustments must be documented via email. If the scope or deliverables materially change, a revised SOW will be issued. Reference this [OWL Scope of Work Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUtK-JRy7tho6ctArb4xViCqtIkkWfB3vazpm-RIVxo/edit?usp=sharing) and [Example OWL Service Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1br4BXUVkxq2ASWy6z6U3c273ROUnRUc4n54Y9CiqwbM/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

#### **3.1.2. Stage 2: Planning & Preparation**

Prior to delivery, Fellows will work with the OWL Program Manager to prepare:

* **The Client Intake Call:** Held 4–8 weeks prior to service delivery, this virtual meeting ensures alignment on goals, logistics, and audience. All participants (OWL, contractor, and client) are expected to join.  
* **Co-Design Planning:** At least one week before service, OWL will convene a planning session to verify the following (aligned to the “[5P rule](https://www.zellalife.com/blog/proper-preparation-prevents-poor-performance/)”):  
  * Slide decks and workshop materials\* (including timing, transitions, and roles).  
  * Anchor documents (including links and references).  
  * Tech tools (e.g., Zoom, Padlet, Mural, Google Docs).  
  * Physical materials and supplies (if in person): chart paper, markers, swag, snacks, etc.  
  * Milestones and clear success outcomes per client input.

  **\*** Materials created by OWL Fellows may be incorporated into OWL’s open-source knowledge base, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.

#### **3.1.3 Stage 3: Service Delivery**

Fellows deliver the service as described in the SOW. This may include PD facilitation, design sprints, coaching sessions, or strategic planning workshops. Contractors are expected to:

* Engage participants with high-quality facilitation.  
* Align content with OWL’s Competency Framework.  
* Maintain flexibility while adhering to key goals and deliverables.

If urgent issues, changes, or needs arise, the Fellow should immediately notify the OWL Program Manager for support or coordination.

#### **3.1.4. Stage 4: Post-Service Follow-Up**

* **Fellow Deliverable** (due within 1 week of the session):  
  * A trip report or reflection via a form, Google Doc, or email outlining:  
    * Key takeaways or insights  
    * Participant engagement highlights  
    * Suggested next steps or improvements

* **OWL Follow-Up to Client** (within 2 weeks):  
  * Joint post-service email from the OWL Program Manager and Fellow with:  
    * A follow-up survey ([OWL Quality of Service Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdl0cyLeC39Igby_Rpif4wZguIW-JzXJxkY3Y4HAG8SVP0Iaw/viewform) or other client-requested evaluation tool).  
    * Updated anchor documents and session resources.  
    * Certificates of completion, if requested (reference [Example Certificate of Completion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cXC8-aedtm8uWXgsHDjGxx_OALVcp8A0ZCmycqyxwYM/edit?usp=sharing)).  
    * Specific next steps tied to the client MOU or contract.

* **Feedback & Debrief:** Fellows may receive confidential feedback from clients or participants, shared by the OWL Program Manager. This information is intended for professional growth and must remain internal. A debrief meeting may be scheduled within two weeks for reflection and improvement.

#### **3.1.5 Stage 5: Invoicing, Payment, and Compensation**

**Important: Standard cash terms and preferred conditions**  
All contractor Scopes of Work (SOWs) should, by default, follow OWL’s standard cash terms and preferred conditions unless the Director of Finance & Internal Operations (DFO), in partnership with the Project Manager and relevant Director, approves exceptions based on client context (for example, school district procurement rules). Standard practice includes deposit-plus-milestone billing rather than 100% at the end of the engagement, reasonable payment terms (such as Net-15 or Net-30) with ACH as the default payment method, clear change-order and cancellation language, and travel reimbursed at cost in alignment with OWL’s Travel Policy and a virtual-first mindset. These are OWL’s preferred terms; in practice, some clients may negotiate specific elements. The DFO maintains current margin expectations, contractor-spend ceilings, and other financial guardrails in OWL’s budgeting and estimation tools, and Directors and PMs should consult those tools when staffing and scoping work. See Appendix D: OWL Contractor Staffing Decision Tree for how these guardrails are applied when deciding between internal staff and contractors.

OWL is committed to fair, transparent, and mission-aligned compensation practices for all contractors. To ensure consistency and equity across engagements, OWL uses a tiered compensation system\*, grounded in [OWL’s Competencies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3ixR8d4Hrl2RxoPk0kSUsd80oNu_DYOGKtHfJWi0gI/edit?usp=sharing), experience, and contributions to our shared work. 

Contractors are paid based on the scope of services outlined in each approved Scope of Work (SOW), with specific expectations for planning, delivery, and reimbursable expenses outlined in that agreement. OWL strives to process all approved invoices within 30 days of receipt.

To support clarity, all guidance related to rates, tiers, travel reimbursement, invoice timelines, required documentation, referral incentives, and advancement criteria can be found in the “Independent Contractor Payment Terms” section of this manual. This includes detailed examples, the tier scoring rubric, and guidance for requesting tier reviews.

**Important:** Before submitting any invoice or seeking tier advancement, OWL Fellows should review the current version of the “Independent Contractor Payment Terms” section in this manual as posted in OWL’s documentation hub. If you have questions about how the payment structure applies to a particular engagement or your tier assignment, please contact the OWL Program Manager for the contract in question or the OWL Director designated to oversee contractor and Fellow relations.

*\*OWL’s tiered system is designed to reward demonstrated competency and contributions while ensuring sustainability as a nonprofit. While rates may differ from private consulting firms, they reflect OWL’s commitment to equity, fairness, and mission-first service.*

## **4 \- Contractor Compensation Guidelines**

This section of the Contractor Manual outlines OWL’s values-driven approach to determining compensation for independent contractors, especially those serving as OWL Fellows. While not a rigid policy, it offers a flexible framework to support thoughtful, case-by-case decisions that reflect the project’s scope, funding availability, and alignment with OWL’s mission. It is designed to ensure clarity, equity, and alignment with OWL’s values, while remaining adaptable to individual contract terms and the financial realities of each project.

While this is not a rigid policy, it provides an intentional starting point to guide case-by-case compensation decisions through a shared philosophy and transparent rationale.

The most current version of these guidelines is maintained in OWL’s documentation hub (currently GitBook) and supersedes any earlier drafts or copies.

### **4.1 Philosophical Foundation**

OWL’s approach to contractor compensation is grounded in the same principles that shape internal compensation for employees:

* **Equity & Impact**: Rates reflect a contractor’s expertise, lived experience, and contribution to learner-centered innovation \- without bias.

* **Transparency**: Clear guidance is available for how to qualify for and progress through contractor tiers.

* **Sustainability**: OWL retains 20–25% of client revenue to sustain core nonprofit operations, knowledge development, and public resources.

* **Mission over Market Rates**: We acknowledge our rates may not match national consulting averages, but we prioritize mission alignment, flexibility, trust, and co-ownership as additional forms of value.

* **Context-Responsive Design**: Rates are co-developed based on the specific scope, goals, and funding for each project \- balancing clarity with adaptability.

*Note: In some cases, client contracts may impose budget ceilings that limit OWL’s ability to offer previously agreed-upon or tier-based rates. In such cases, the contractor is under no obligation to accept the assignment and may choose to decline the engagement or negotiate a mutually acceptable reduced rate with OWL.*

### **4.2 Consultant Tiers & Pay Ranges**

OWL determines an individual’s initial tier during onboarding or when assigning a new Scope of Work. Advancement may occur based on documented demonstration of OWL’s core competencies, positive feedback from project delivery, and increased complexity of assigned work. OWL Contractors/Fellows may also request a tier review after completing three OWL projects or 12 months of engagement, whichever comes first.

The following ranges reflect the most common compensation levels used by OWL for direct services (e.g., facilitation, design, coaching), but actual rates are defined in each scope of work based on project specifics.

| Tier | Title | Typical Range | Profile Summary |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | Associate Consultant | $50–$80/hr | New to OWL and works toward co-facilitating established OWL sessions or providing coaching under direction as they develop fluency in OWL frameworks and client-facing practices. |
| **2** | Core Consultant | $60–$110/hr | Strong alignment to OWL approach, consistently positive evaluations, serves as confident OWL facilitator or coach. |
| **3** | Senior Consultant | $100–$125/hr | Advanced competency, often serves as lead designer, evaluator, or advisor for complex projects. Mentors other Fellows, contributes to innovation or tool creation, and consistently earns high ratings in client feedback and internal debriefs. |
| **4** | Strategic/Expert Lead | $110–$150+/hr | High-demand expert; national or system-wide presence or reputation; models the full OWL competency spectrum |

***Note:** All rates are subject to final approval based on project scope and funding availability. For shorter engagements or partial-day work, rates may be calculated on a half-day or hourly basis using the above estimates.*

*OWL’s standard daily facilitation rate is calculated based on approximately 6–7 hours of direct service time, typically translating to 7x the hourly rate. For example, a contractor with an approved hourly rate of $75 would receive a daily rate of $525 (i.e. $75 × 7 hours). This daily rate may be adjusted depending on the contractor’s tier, the complexity of the service, and the project’s funding capacity.*

### **4.3 Consultant Tier Rubric (Out of 40 Points)**

OWL’s objective scoring system that is used evaluates a contractor’s readiness and advancement:

| Dimension | Criteria | Max Points |
| ----- | ----- | :---: |
| **Education Experience** | K–12 classroom or school experience/system leadership (1 pt/year) | 10 |
| **Adult Learning / PD Experience** | Engaging, interactive PD design, coaching, facilitation (2 pts/year) | 10 |
| **OWL-Specific Experience** | OWL Fellow (5), Ambassador (2), participation in past OWL projects/design sprints/workshops (1–3 each), familiarity with OWL tools, resources, and/or co-design process (up to 5\) | 10 |
| **Competency Proficiency** | Demonstration of proficiency with OWL’s 6 competency domains (coaching, facilitation, pedagogy, philosophy, communication, leadership) | 10 |

**Tier Mapping:**

* 0–15 pts → Tier 1  
* 16–25 pts → Tier 2  
* 26–34 pts → Tier 3  
* 35–40 pts → Tier 4

### **4.4 Fellowship Integration**

#### **4.4.1 OWL Ambassadors and Fellows**

* **Ambassadors**: Volunteer champions who model OWL’s mission within their own learning communities.  
* **Fellows**: Recognized leaders in the OWL ecosystem who have demonstrated large-scale impact and alignment with OWL’s values.  
* **Fellowship and Compensation**:  
  * Fellows do not automatically receive consulting work, but are prioritized for opportunities based on availability, fit, and funding.  
  * Most Fellows qualify for Tier 3 or Tier 4 pay once actively engaged in OWL service delivery.  
  * Pay is based on actual services rendered, not title alone.

  #### **4.4.2. Contribution-Based Advancement:**

* Fellows who complete 1–2 services/year with positive feedback may maintain Tier 3 status.  
* Fellows who complete 6+ high-quality services/year and demonstrate leadership, adaptability, and tool creation may be considered for advancement to Tier 4\.

### **4.5 Client Rate Percentage Model**

OWL’s client-facing rates and contractor pay percentages reflect a need to balance fair compensation with the long-term sustainability of a small nonprofit. This ensures we can reinvest in innovation, open-source tools, and broader field-building efforts that benefit all.

| Service Type | Contractor Pay | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Face-to-Face Facilitation | 80% of client rate or tier minimum | High engagement delivery |
| Virtual Facilitation | 75% of client rate or tier minimum | Online workshops or coaching |
| Planning/Prep | 75% of agreed delivery rate | Half-day minimum applies |
| Curriculum Dev / Internal | $80–$100/hr or as scoped | Final rates for curriculum development, conferences, or other scoped work will be negotiated based on complexity, timeline, and expertise required, and must be documented in the approved Scope of Work. |

*Note that OWL retains 20–25% for operations and IP development. Contractor pay does not equal full client rate.*

### **4.6 Travel Reimbursement**

Pre-approved travel (lodging, meals, mileage, transport) is reimbursed per [OWL’s Travel Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lvw8vxFSF2Qf0LbIIPfAN4ur2GNZEkgTKLCkuOhJ0o/edit?usp=sharing). 

### **4.7 Referral Incentive**

* OWL offers a one-time incentive to contractors who successfully refer new clients that result in executed contracts with the nonprofit. This program applies to the business development portion of this agreement and is subject to the following terms:  
  * **Eligibility Criteria:** The referral must result in a new, first-time client entering into a signed contract with OWL. Only one incentive may be awarded per referred client, and the referring contractor must have played a direct and documented role in initiating and securing the opportunity. OWL leadership retains the sole authority to determine eligibility.  
  * **Incentive Amounts:**  
    * $500 for referred projects with a total contract value of less than $10,000  
    * $1,000 for referred projects with a total contract value of $10,000 or more  
* **Payout Terms:** Incentive payments will be issued only after OWL has received the first payment from the referred client under the executed contract. The incentive applies only to the initial contract and does not extend to future or recurring work from the same client.

  ### **4.8 Invoicing & Payment**

* Invoices are due within **45 days** of service.  
* Use [OWL’s invoice template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_pHcdQ-ISu2A58pzKK-nfo9sPKoFsFU0f1fLwtqmpTs/edit?usp=sharing) with categories (e.g., planning, facilitation, travel) unless you have your own.  
* Whenever possible, OWL processes contractor payments via ACH/direct deposit for those who have a completed Direct Deposit Authorization Form on file; this method reduces processing time and administrative cost.  
* Invoices should be submitted **by the 15th of each month** whenever possible, to ensure processing and payment by the end of that month, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Scope of Work. OWL’s goal is to ensure payment is processed within **30 days** of approval.

### **4.9 Advancement & Feedback**

### **4.10 Legal & Financial Responsibility Disclaimer**

All consultants working with Open Way Learning (OWL) under an approved Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) are recognized as independent contractors and **not employees** of OWL. As such:

* Consultants are **solely responsible** for reporting and paying all applicable federal, state, and local taxes, including but not limited to income tax, Social Security, and other employment-related obligations.  
* Consultants are **not eligible** for employee benefits, insurance, or supplemental revenue sharing plans offered to OWL employees.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, consultants agree to **indemnify and hold harmless OWL** from any and all claims, liabilities, demands, or actions related to:

* Tax reporting or payment obligations  
* Employment status or benefits  
* Workers’ compensation or other employee-related claims

By engaging in contracted work under an ICA, the consultant acknowledges that this Pay Determination Procedure is incorporated into the terms of their agreement and agrees to abide by all expectations, conditions, and responsibilities outlined herein.

## **Appendix A: Definitions of Key Terms & Documents**

To ensure consistency, transparency, and compliance, OWL uses the following key documents in its contractor engagement process:

* **Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA):** The ICA is a legal agreement between OWL and the contractor that outlines the terms of the independent contractor relationship (per the IRS form 1099). It defines the contractor's status, general responsibilities, compensation structure, tax obligations, confidentiality terms, non-solicitation clauses, and legal protections. The ICA must be signed before any services can be provided.

* **Scope of Work (SOW):** The SOW is a project-specific addendum to the ICA that outlines the what, when, where, and how of a particular engagement. It includes details such as the description of services, duration, deliverables, client and OWL points of contact, reimbursement policies, and any specific requirements tied to that project. All work performed by an OWL Fellow must be explicitly listed in an approved SOW.

* **Client-Facing Proposal**: This is the initial document OWL provides to potential or current clients. It summarizes the proposed goals, services, timeline, and budget for a prospective engagement. It is not legally binding, but serves as the foundation for future planning and (if accepted) will inform the creation of a Scope of Work and client contract.

* **Client Contract:** The formal agreement between OWL and the client organization. It details deliverables, responsibilities, payment terms, timelines, and other terms mutually agreed upon. The client contract is signed by an authorized representative of the client and OWL leadership. It may incorporate or reference the Client-Facing Proposal. *While the SOW governs the contractor's specific work, the Client Contract outlines the full agreement between OWL and the client, which may include multiple deliverables, roles, or vendors.*

* **Invoice:** A billing document submitted by the contractor to OWL for completed services. It should include an itemized list of service hours and categories (e.g., facilitation, planning, travel), aligned with the approved Scope of Work. Invoices must follow OWL’s submission schedule and formatting requirements.

## **Appendix B: OWL Contractor Compensation Benchmarks**

OWL uses a tiered contractor compensation model informed by credible, mission-aligned nonprofit organizations. The following summarizes realistic benchmarks that OWL uses to guide contractor compensation decisions and ensure fairness across service types and tiers.

### **B.1. Primary Benchmark Sources:**

1. **PBLWorks (Buck Institute for Education) – Actual NF Rate (as of 2022\)**  
   * $75/hour – for workshop facilitation, coaching, and planning  
   * Applies to trained National Faculty with advanced facilitation credentials  
   * Note: Advertised “external” rates ($900–$1,200/day) are typically billed to clients, not paid to contractors

2. **Learning Forward – Consultant Rate Benchmarks**  
   * $900–$1,300/day to clients  
   * Estimated contractor pay: $100–$125/hour for high-expertise instructional consultants

3. **Independent Sector – Nonprofit Labor Valuation**  
   * $33.49/hour \= national baseline (not contractor-level compensation)  
   * Contractor pay in education nonprofits should generally be 2–3x this baseline

### **B.2. Benchmark Contractor Rates**

| Service Type | Typical Contractor Rates | Equivalent Hourly Range |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| Full-Day Facilitation (6–8 hrs) | $600–$1,000/day | $75–$125/hour |
| Half-Day Facilitation (3–4 hrs) | $300–$500/half day | $75–$125/hour |
| Planning & Development | $60–$100/hour |  \-  |
| Virtual Coaching | $75–$125/hour |  \-  |

*Disclaimer:  This rate range is intended as a starting point to guide the determination of a fair and equitable initial pay rate for contractors. OWL will always strive to align compensation with experience, service type, and scope complexity. Note however, that certain client contracts may include budget ceilings that limit OWL’s ability to offer previously agreed-upon or tier-based rates. In such cases, the contractor is under no obligation to accept the assignment and may choose to decline the engagement or negotiate a mutually acceptable reduced rate with OWL.*

## **Appendix C: Example Scenarios \- Tiered Compensation in Practice**

### **C.1 Scenario 1: Virtual Workshop – Core Consultant (Tier 2\)**

* **Client Rate**: $120/hour  
* **Consultant Tier**: Tier 2 – Core Consultant  
* **Pay Rate**: 75% of client rate \= $90/hour  
* **Hours Worked**:  
  * 2 hours planning  
  * 3 hours live virtual facilitation

**Total Pay**:  (2 hrs × $90) \+ (3 hrs × $90) \= **$450**

*Note: If the client rate had been lower (e.g., $100/hour), OWL would still ensure the consultant received at least the Tier 2 minimum rate of $60/hour.*

### **C.2 Scenario 2: In-Person Workshop – Senior Consultant (Tier 3\)**

* **Client Rate**: $1,500/day (8 hours)  
* **Consultant Tier**: Tier 3 – Senior Consultant  
* **Pay Rate**: 80% of client rate \= $1,200/day \= $150/hour  
* **Hours Worked**:  
  * 1 day of facilitation  
  * 4 hours of prep time

**Total Pay**:  (8 hrs × $150) \+ (4 hrs × $112.50) \=  $1,200 \+ $450 \= **$1,650**

*Prep time is compensated at 75% of the daily rate. Consultant also receives full travel reimbursement per OWL’s travel policy.*

### **C.3 Scenario 3: In-Person Workshop – Senior Consultant (Tier 3\)**

* **Client Rate**: $1,200/day (8 hours)  
* **Consultant Tier**: Tier 3 – Senior Consultant  
* **Pay Rate**: 80% of client rate \= **$960/day \= $120/hour**  
* **Hours Worked**:  
  * 1 day of facilitation (8 hours)  
  * 4 hours of planning (billed at 75% of daily rate \= $90/hour)

**Total Pay**: (8 × $120) \+ (4 × $90) \= $960 \+ $360 \= **$1,320**

*Travel reimbursed separately.*

### **C.4 Scenario 4: Curriculum Development – Core Consultant (Tier 2\)**

* **Client Rate**: N/A (internal scope)  
* **Consultant Tier**: Tier 2 – Core Consultant  
* **Agreed Rate**: $80/hour (based on scope and tier)  
* **Hours Worked**: 10 hours over 2 weeks

**Total Pay**:  10 × $80 \= **$800**

*Rate was defined in Scope of Work. Project involved adapting OWL tools for a middle school PBL unit.*

### **C.5 Scenario 5: Multi-Day Engagement – OWL Fellow (Tier 3/4)**

* **Client Rate**: $1,200/day  
* **Consultant Tier**: Tier 4 – Strategic/Expert Lead  
* **Pay Rate**: 80% of client rate \= **$960/day**  
* **Services Rendered**:  
  * 2-day in-person training (16 hours)  
  * 6 hours of planning  
  * 2 hours of virtual follow-up coaching

**Total Pay**:

* Facilitation: 16 × $120 \= $1,920

* Coaching: 2 × $90 \= $180

**Grand Total**: **$2,640**

*This Fellow is highly experienced and leads 6+ OWL engagements/year. As a result, they are compensated at the top of Tier 4 and may also contribute to strategic projects.*

## **Appendix D: OWL Contractor Staffing Decision Tree**

**Purpose:** This appendix provides a simple decision aid for OWL Directors and Project Managers when deciding whether to staff work with a salaried OWL employee or an independent contractor (including OWL Fellows). It is designed to align with:

* This Contractor Manual (especially Sections 1.0–3.0),  
* The OWL Productive Playbook (scoping, estimating, and budgeting),  
* The OWL Client Engagement Playbook (PM responsibilities and lifecycle), and  
* Other related procedures such as the OWL Travel Policy, Document Control Policy, etc.

Use this tree to make the *staffing decision* first. Then follow the checklist at the end to ensure you honor the applicable policies and procedures.

### **Part 1 – Staffing Decision Tree**

#### **Step 1 – Confirm that the work is client-facing**

**Question:** *Is this work part of a defined client-facing service or partnership deliverable?*

* **If Yes (client-facing work):** Treat this as part of an existing or anticipated client engagement. Proceed to Step 2\.  
* **If No (internal work):** This is internal R\&D, marketing, or operational work. Ask: *Are we considering a contractor because the work requires specialized expertise or because doing it internally would materially detract from the routine roles and responsibilities of OWL personnel?*

  * **If No:** Staff the work with an OWL employee. Do not use a contractor. Stop here.  
  * **If Yes:** Treat this as a potential contractor/OWL Fellow engagement, but:  
    * Verify that there is a clearly defined internal scope (specific deliverables, start and stop dates, and spending caps).  
    * If this is an unbudgeted internal investment, it requires consensus approval from all OWL Directors before moving forward.  
    * Proceed to Step 2\.

#### **Step 2 – Worker-classification screen**

**Question:** *Does the work require ongoing, day-to-day direction, set hours, or core operational responsibilities (recurring for approximately three months or longer)?*

* **If Yes:** Staff with an OWL employee (hourly, part-time, or full-time). Do *not* use a contractor for this role. Stop here.  
* **If No:** The work is project-based and time-bound. Proceed to Step 3\.

**Note:** The reason for this question is to maintain IRS-compliant contractor boundaries \- i.e. contractors should deliver scoped outcomes under a specific Scope of Work (SOW), not perform ongoing employee-like duties.

#### **Step 3 – Confirm contract / approval and Scope of Work**

**Question:** *Do we have appropriate approval and scope in place?*

Note that for client-facing work this means a signed client contract *and* a clearly approved Scope of Work (SOW) for the project or phase. For internal work this means a documented internal SOW (what, when, who, and how much), *and* an approved budget line or explicit Director consensus if this is a new/unbudgeted investment.

* **If No:** Do *not* hire or assign work yet. Complete the required client contract, internal approval, and SOW before proceeding.  
* **If Yes:** Proceed to Step 4\.

#### **Step 4 – Confirm budget set-up in Productive**

**Question:** *Has a project (or internal) budget been created in Productive that reflects this work?*

* **If No:** Create a budget using the OWL Productive Playbook (Estimator \+ budget creation), including labor, contractor costs (if any), travel, and other expenses.  
* **If Yes:** Proceed to Step 5\.

#### **Step 5 – Specialized expertise?**

**Question:** *Does the work require specialized expertise beyond OWL’s current salaried staff?*

**Examples:** 

* Highly specialized technical content outside the team’s core strengths.  
  * Unique context or lived experience that OWL does not currently have on staff, but that is essential to the engagement.  
  * Creative, design, IT, or communications work that is not part of any OWL employee’s regular role.

* **If Yes:** A contractor or OWL Fellow is likely appropriate for this work, assuming financial guardrails are met. This sets the default staffing choice to contractor/Fellow. Proceed to Part 2 – Post-Decision Checklist.  
* **If No:**  Our existing team can credibly deliver this work. Proceed to **Step 6**.

**Important note on internal project management:** If the *primary* role is internal project management of OWL operations (for example, core coordination and internal systems work or being the primary Program Manager for a client-facing engagement), assign the work to salaried staff. Contractors may support specialized deliverables, but may not function as OWL’s primary PM.

#### **Step 6 – Internal staff capacity and fit**

**Question:** *Given current commitments, can we reasonably staff this work with existing OWL personnel without causing burnout or breaking the budget?*

* **If Yes (capacity exists):** Staff the work with an OWL employee (hourly, part-time, or full-time). This is an OWL employee assignment. Proceed to Part 2 – Post-Decision Checklist to ensure proper setup.  
* **If No (capacity does *not* exist):** Staff the work with a contractor or OWL Fellow, assuming financial guardrails are met and the engagement remains time-bound. Proceed to Part 2 – Post-Decision Checklist.

**Example criteria for “surge beyond capacity” (non-exhaustive):**

* The likely staff member would be booked in the field more than \~50% of workdays over a month.  
* Travel requirements, when added to existing commitments, would push them beyond a sustainable number of nights away.  
* Required planning and follow-up would push their workload beyond a sustainable weekly range over multiple weeks.  
* Adding this engagement would force them to drop or delay other high-priority OWL commitments.

The DFO, with other OWL Directors, should periodically refine these criteria based on experience and feedback to prevent burnout and protect quality.

**Note that at this point, you should have made the staffing decision: OWL employee vs contractor/OWL Fellow. The remaining steps are no longer about *who*; they’re about doing the work in a way that matches OWL’s policies, guardrails, and documentation discipline.**

### **Part 2 – Post-Decision Requirements Checklist**

Use this checklist every time, regardless of whether the work is staffed with an OWL employee or a contractor/Fellow. 

#### **A. Service days and resourcing**

* Ensure actual and/or forecasted service days are added to Productive’s Scheduler / Resourcing Tool so required facilitation days are booked and visible: 

  - [ ] For contractors/Fellows, assign them to the appropriate project and task categories in Productive so effort, costs, and utilization are tracked correctly.  
  - [ ] For OWL employees, make sure their additional service days are visible in Resourcing to avoid double-booking and to keep an eye on total load.

**Primary references:**

* OWL Productive Playbook – sections on creating budgets, assigning resources, and using the Scheduler.  
* OWL Client Engagement Playbook – sections describing PM responsibilities for resourcing and scheduling.

#### **B. Budget and financial guardrails**

* Use the Estimator / budget tools maintained by the DFO to confirm that:

  - [ ] The project meets OWL’s current margin expectations after all labor, contractor, and travel costs.  
  - [ ] Any use of contractors or Fellows fits within current monthly contractor-spend ceilings and other financial guardrails.   
  - [ ] For restricted-use or grant-funded projects, all staffing and coding align with the restrictions and any required set-asides.

* If any of these checks fail, do *not* proceed as currently scoped. Re-scope the work, delay, or redistribute internal capacity in consultation with the DFO and relevant Director.

**Primary references:**

* OWL Productive Playbook – Estimator workflow, margin and pricing guardrails, and budget setup.  
* Contractor Manual – Sections on compensation, SOWs, and contractor boundaries.  
* Any active grant-specific guidance (for example, WNCRP) as maintained by the DFO and project Program Managers.

#### **C. SOW, rates, and preferred terms (for contractors / Fellows)**

When a **contractor or OWL Fellow** is used:

* Draft a project-specific SOW to align with their ICA using OWL’s current SOW / ICA templates and approved rate tiers/compensation structures found in this manual. These should clearly define:

  - [ ] Deliverables and milestones.  
  - [ ] Timelines and expected planning/facilitation/follow-up.  
  - [ ] Travel assumptions and expectations for virtual vs in-person work.  
  - [ ] Communication cadence and primary OWL point of contact.

* Apply OWL’s standard preferred terms for cash discipline and risk management. These usually include:

  - [ ] Deposit-plus-milestone billing (rather than 100% at project end).  
  - [ ] Reasonable payment terms (for example, Net-15 or Net-30) with ACH as the default payment method.  
  - [ ] Change-order and cancellation language.  
  - [ ] Travel reimbursed at cost in line with the OWL Travel Policy, with a virtual-first mindset and pre-approval for major airfare and lodging.

**Primary references:**

* Contractor Manual – Sections on SOW contents, compensation, and contractor expectations.  
* OWL Productive Playbook – invoicing, terms, and billing cadence.  
* OWL Travel Policy – rules for travel, reimbursement, and virtual-first expectations.

#### **D. Logging, compliance, and records**

For *all* staffed work (internal or contractor):

- [ ] Log roles and assignments in Productive, including resourcing dates, estimated effort, and relevant tags or categories.  
- [ ] Store client contracts, SOWs, and ICAs in the correct Drive folder structure (for example, /02\_External Partners & Clients/\[Client\]/Contracts), following the applicable README document.

- [ ] Confirm AP setup for contractors/Fellows:

      * W-9 on file (as applicable).  
      * ACH information or other required payment details.  
      * Any required vendor registration or purchase orders for the client.

- [ ] Confirm contractor boundaries described in this manual are being honored:

      * No OWL email accounts.  
      * No internal OWL Slack or Productive access (or only very limited, project-specific guest access if explicitly approved).  
      * Only the minimum system access required to deliver the defined scope.

- [ ] For grant-funded or restricted-use projects:

      * Confirm that staffing choices, budget codes, and invoicing practices align with the relevant grant guidance and any set-aside requirements.

**Primary references:**

* Contractor Manual – Sections 1.0–3.0 (roles, access, and SOW workflow).  
* Document Control Procedure for folder naming and filing rules.  
* Any project-specific grant compliance guidance.
