# Development & Partners

{% hint style="info" %}
**Owner:** Director of Program Impact & Visibility (DPIV) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff and contractors/Fellows
{% endhint %}

## Purpose

This section includes the core documents that shape how OWL builds and sustains mission-aligned revenue and partnerships. It centers on the practical "how-to" of working with funders, partner organizations, contractors/Fellows, and other entities in ways that are transparent, equitable, and consistent with our learner-centered values and mission.

This section is actively maintained by the **DPIV**, who ensures that the documents in it are up to date, accessible, and aligned with OWL's financial guardrails, storytelling needs, external commitments, and internal core values. Any proposed changes to these documents should be coordinated with the DPIV (and DFO where relevant) for alignment, accuracy, and final approval.

## What you'll find in this section

While this section overlaps with materials in the `Operations-Finance/`, `Governance/`, and `Outreach-Programming/` sections, the focus here is specifically on **development and partnership infrastructure**—the shared tools we use to cultivate growth opportunities, integrate and leverage strategic partnerships, and work with non-employee collaborators to advance our mission-driven work.

## How to use this section

- Maintaining the **OWL Contractor Manual** and related resources that set expectations, payment terms, and working norms for contractors and Fellows  
- Documenting the **Ambassador and Fellow program** structure, selection pathways, and recognition aligned to OWL’s open-source mission  
- Providing the **Partner Integration Playbook** and related tools that guide how we scope, formalize, and revisit strategic partnerships and MOUs  
- Curating templates and exemplars for proposals, MOUs, and partner communications that reflect OWL’s brand, guardrails, and storytelling standards  
- Ensuring that development and partnership practices in this folder remain consistent with our collective leadership model, R&R documents, and official decision-making processes
