1. ### **OWL’s MISSION & VISION**

Open Way Learning (OWL) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization on a mission to co-design ways to amplify the joy and wonder of learning for every student. We envision a future where all learners can change the world—and schools empower that change to happen now.

Our work centers on helping schools and districts develop, sustain, and scale cultures of learner-centered innovation, with a special focus on students historically furthest from opportunity. We believe that educational transformation doesn’t come from top-down mandates or one-size-fits-all programs—it happens through grassroots innovation that is co-created, deeply human, and grounded in local strengths.

#### **Our Core Beliefs:**

We are driven by three foundational ideas:

1. Culture comes first: Innovation flourishes in school cultures that are rooted in trust, shared leadership, and collective responsibility. Without these foundations, even the best strategies fall flat.  
2. Conditions matter: We’ve seen that cultures of innovation thrive when four conditions are in place:  
   * A shared, living mission and vision  
   * Collective leadership structures  
   * System-wide collaboration  
   * Open exchange of ideas and resources

   These conditions create the ecosystem for transformative learning to take root.

3. The talent is already here: Every school has the creative potential to design better ways of teaching and learning. By applying “the open source way” \- transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, adaptability, and community \- we help unlock and connect that talent in service of sustainable change.

#### **What We Do & How We Work:**

OWL works directly with schools, districts, networks, and education partners to bring our beliefs to life through experiential learning strategies and schoolwide systems change. Our support is always:

* Co-designed with those we serve  
* Customized to local needs, assets, and goals  
* Sustained through coaching, reflection, and iteration  
* Centered on equity and belonging—especially for those most underserved by traditional models

We specialize in helping communities adopt and adapt practices such as:

* Experiential Learning, including Project-, Problem-, Place-, Phenomenon-, and Profession-Based Learning  
* Design Thinking & Strategic Planning  
* Competency-Based and Mastery Learning  
* Advisory Programs and Crew Models  
* STEM, STEAM, and Makerspace integration  
* Community-facing partnerships and policy advocacy

We do this through design sprints, workshops, coaching, school visits, conferences, virtual courses, and open-source resource sharing—all guided by our belief that real innovation grows from trust, agency, and reflection.

#### **Smart Growth at OWL**

Open Way Learning also believes that real change doesn’t come from scaling faster, it comes from scaling wiser. That’s why we pursue smart growth: a commitment to growing in ways that strengthen our values, deepen our impact, and preserve the uniquely human, learner-centered approach that defines who we are as an education nonprofit. We do not exist to become big for the sake of being big. Our goal is also not to saturate the market with one-size-fits-all programs, but to build capacity for schools to lead their own transformation—anchored in culture, relationships, and trust.

Growth for us means growing our ability to go deep, not just wide. We take on new work only when we’re confident we can deliver at the level of quality and partnership that school communities deserve. This includes adapting to local context, investing in co-design, and ensuring our efforts leave behind lasting conditions for continuous improvement (vs. lots of one-off workshops).

As education scholar Jal Mehta writes in [*In Search of Deeper Learning*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674248250), real innovation requires time, trust, and cultural commitment \- not replication at scale. He writes, “The deepest learning tends to occur in the places where students and teachers are part of strong cultures, where adults collaborate around shared purpose, and where experimentation and reflection are valued.” These same conditions equally apply to how we want to grow as an organization.

*In short: We scale trust. We scale culture. We scale impact. And we never scale at the expense of depth.*

This is the throughline in all our work, and a key reason we’ve earned a reputation for doing what many consider hard to do in education: combining vision with the discipline to make it real.

2. ### **OWL’s VALUES**

OWL is serious about a “Living Mission & Vision” and that extends to our values as well. They aren’t something you hang on the wall \- they should *live* as part of what someone experiences in practice and partnership with OWL every day \- in conversations, decisions, feedback, and follow-through.

The following values represent not just how we aspire to work, but how we actually work: with each other, with the schools and communities we serve, and with the broader network of partners who share our vision of a better, more learner-centered future for education. They also reflect the deep commitments that shape our culture as an open organization, rooted in the belief that transparency, collaboration, and equity are not just buzzwords, but the foundation for sustainable transformation.

#### **Integrity in Action**

At OWL, we care deeply about results, but never at the expense of how we achieve them. We hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards, guided by mission-driven principles and a deep sense of fairness in all our relationships. This commitment is personal. OWL Co-Founder Ben Owens often shares advice from his grandfather:

*"The most important thing you have in life is your name—it can take years to build a good one and only a second to destroy it."*

That simple truth still drives how we show up \- for our team, our partners, and the students we ultimately serve. Our reputation is not just a reflection of the work we deliver, but a reflection of who we are.

#### **Transparency & Trust**

We believe that openness builds trust and that trust builds everything else. That is why we default to making our thinking, progress, and process visible to others, in real time, not just after the work is finished. We also default to thoroughly documenting our decisions and sharing what we know. Whether it’s a facilitation strategy, a draft policy, or a project plan, we aim to make our work visible and accessible to all stakeholders. That includes internal team members, OWL Fellows, school partners, and beyond.

We also assume positive intent, give and receive candid feedback, and name tensions early, because we know that trust doesn’t grow in the dark. It grows when people feel seen, heard, and respected.

#### **Equity & Belonging**

* We believe every student deserves access to learning that is meaningful, affirming, and life-changing. That belief extends to every person we work with, too.  
* We are committed to co-creating spaces where people of all backgrounds (i.e. across race, gender, geography, income, ability, identity, lived experience, etc.) can thrive and contribute. This isn’t about politics. It’s about people.  
* We know that historically our education systems haven’t served all students equally. That’s why our work centers on closing opportunity gaps, not widening them. We don’t just want innovation to scale, we want it to reach. Equity without access is just rhetoric. We strive to ensure our work positively disrupts comfortable patterns of the status quo by creating new, locally-generated possibilities for every student.

#### **Adaptability & Iteration**

* We proudly operate in a state of [perpetual beta](https://www.td.org/content/atd-blog/perpetual-beta-the-new-world-of-work).  
* We believe that relevance, responsiveness, and refinement are signs of strength \- not weakness. We seek radically candid feedback early and often. We pivot when needed. We test ideas, learn from what doesn’t work, and iterate toward something better.  
* This continual improvement mindset helps us serve schools with humility and flexibility. No two communities are alike, so no two engagements should look the same. Our culture of iteration drives our focus on hyper-customization by ensuring we’re always learning how to serve our partners more meaningfully and more effectively.

#### **Collaboration by Default**

* We recognize that the best solutions are rarely designed in isolation. Whether working internally across roles or externally with clients and partners, we build with \- not for \- others. Collaboration isn’t just our default process. It’s a reflection of our deep respect for collective wisdom.  
* We work to create environments where every voice is valued, including those of students, knowing that often the quietest ideas are often the most profound. We believe that when people feel safe to contribute, everyone benefits. *The idea is that not every idea is implemented, but every idea is heard.*

#### **Collective Leadership & Community**

* OWL’s leadership model is open and distributed because we believe leadership is a practice, not a position.  
* Every team member is empowered to make informed, mission-aligned decisions based on our shared strategic goals. We use tools like RACI matrices and open protocols to clarify ownership, reduce confusion, and keep momentum going.  
* Our collective leadership model builds internal capacity, accelerates progress, and ensures that the best ideas rise regardless of where they come from (based on the open source idea that *the code talks\**). Leadership is everyone’s responsibility and it thrives in a culture of trust, clarity, and mutual accountability.

  *\*The concept of "the code talks" refers to how open-source coding offers a significant advantage for continuous improvement due to its collaborative nature, rapid feedback loops, and inherent transparency. By enabling developers to contribute, review, and refine code publicly, open-source projects benefit from a diverse pool of talent and insights, leading to faster development, bug fixes, and creation of cutting-edge software.*

#### **Quality & Craft**

* We take great pride in both what we do and how we do it. Whether designing a single workshop or supporting a long-term culture shift across a district, we set a high bar—customizing every engagement, obsessing over the details, and relentlessly seeking ways to improve. Our work is grounded in humility, precision, and purpose.  
* Our goal isn’t just to be effective—it’s to be genuinely transformative. We strive to deliver experiences that feel fundamentally different from traditional professional development. That means creating environments where educators are not passive recipients of a prescribed program, but active co-creators in a process that values their ideas, honors their expertise, and builds capacity for lasting change.  
* We fiercely protect our reputation for excellence, because we understand the trust that schools place in us—trust that involves not just their time and resources, but their people, their hopes, and their commitment to something better.

#### **Learning & Growth**

* We are a [learning organization](https://www.ednc.org/perspective-the-key-ingredient-for-innovation/) \- not just in name, but in practice. Inspired by Peter Senge and other thought leaders, we believe learning is a continuous, collective responsibility. We invest in our own growth and that of our partners. We know that when we learn, we improve, and when we improve, we create greater impact.  
* We embrace calculated risks, lean into complexity, and treat failure as a stepping stone, not a stopping point. This mindset allows us to fail forward: to reflect, adapt, and rise stronger.  
* We also follow the principle of “go slow to go fast” \- taking the time to build clarity, relationships, and shared purpose up front, so we can move with confidence and cohesion down the line.

These values aren’t just aspirational \- they’re operational. They shape how we design our work, how we build our culture, and how we navigate challenges together. They show up in the details of a workshop plan, in the way we give feedback, and in the choices we make when no one’s watching. Our hope and our expectation is that you’ll live these values not as a checklist, but as a compass. A way to stay aligned to our shared purpose, mission, and vision. 

3. ### **THE OPEN WAY LEARNING HISTORY**

*“Who wants to research this technology and bring their findings back to the team?”*  
*“What’s needed for us to scale this work to other areas?”*  
*“What data do we need to better understand the impact of this solution?”*

You might expect to hear these questions in a Silicon Valley innovation lab, but they were common refrains in the Critical Friends meetings at Tri-County Early College High School (TCEC) in rural western North Carolina. Every two weeks, the full teaching staff and administrators would gather not just to plan lessons, but to collaborate, challenge each other, and co-design school-wide strategies to better meet the needs of their students.

TCEC may not be a household name, but it was modeled after schools that are, like High Tech High, University Park Campus School in Boston, and Manor New Tech High in Texas. Launched in 2006 with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the school served a population of first-generation college-goers and students who had historically been underserved by traditional systems. From the start, the mission was clear: do school differently.

That meant embracing practices that looked more like a high-performing startup than a conventional high school: competency-based education, interdisciplinary project-based learning, place-based service learning, student-led e-portfolios, arts-integrated STEM, and a strong focus on social-emotional learning through daily Advisory. It meant rethinking everything, from schedules to assessments to how staff made decisions. And it worked. TCEC quickly built a track record of success with students who had previously struggled in traditional settings.

A pivotal moment came in 2015, when the school was named a finalist in the national XQ Super School Challenge. Though it didn’t win the grant, the process became a catalyst for deeper transformation. The school revisited its mission and vision, doubled down on student-centered innovation, and fully embraced the open source way \- a cultural framework rooted in transparency, community, collaboration, inclusivity, and adaptability. What followed was a set of radical, yet practical shifts:

* Interdisciplinary, cross-grade, community-facing projects  
* Flexible scheduling and advisory structures  
* Mentorship embedded in all student projects  
* Teacher-led governance through a Business Advisory Council and professional learning rounds

For co-founders Ben Owens and Adam Haigler, who were leading this work from inside this “[Teacher Powered](https://www.teacherpowered.org/)” school, these changes weren’t theoretical, they were deeply personal. They saw how a school culture grounded in shared leadership, real-time iteration, and collective purpose could transform both student outcomes and educator engagement. And they knew this wasn’t unique to one school \- it could be the foundation for broader change.

This led to their co-authored book, [*Open Up Education\! How Open Way Learning Can Transform Schools*](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781475842005/Open-Up-Education!-How-Open-Way-Learning-Can-Transform-Schools), which captured the principles behind the work and connected them to a broader ecosystem of educators, researchers, and innovators around the world.

By 2018, Ben left the classroom to form what would eventually become Open Way Learning (originally Open Way PBL, LLC), a nonprofit dedicated to helping schools everywhere build learner-centered cultures of innovation. Adam joined full-time in 2020 and together, they began working with schools and districts across the country, sharing not a scripted model, but a mindset and method for transformation rooted in co-design, openness, and trust.

Today, OWL is a growing team of passionate educators and partners helping schools reimagine what’s possible, not by imposing change from the outside, but by unlocking the creativity and expertise that already exists within each community. We support this through design sprints, workshops, coaching, school redesign, and policy advocacy. We are driven by the belief that innovation doesn’t scale through compliance, it scales through community.

And now, the story includes you\! The fact that you’re reading this means you are now part of OWL’s story. And just like the educators and students at TCEC, your insights, creativity, and questions will shape what comes next.

We see OWL as a living, evolving organization \- a collective of people working toward a shared mission to amplify the joy and wonder of learning. Our culture is stronger because it adapts, and our impact is deeper because it grows through the contributions of every person who joins us.

So bring your perspective. Share your ideas. Ask hard questions. The next chapter of OWL’s story is being written right now \- and it’s better with you in it.

4. ### **THE COLLABORATIVE CULTURE WE MODEL IN OUR WORK**

OWL’s working philosophy (that everyone can contribute, regardless of title, tenure with the organization, etc.) means that everyone on our team is empowered to bring our mission and vision to life by making a positive, value-adding impact with everything they do. Every day. We are able to effectively model this approach because our team brings a vast and diverse array of experience (in and out of education) to the table. As such, no one should feel that they don't have to have the required degree, certification, minimum service time, or specific role that makes them less of a contributor to the important work OWL does or to the tools we use. 

This open, radically collaborative, collective leadership approach works because we're a team of passionate people who want to help each other, our nonprofit, and the educators we network with in the broader OWL community succeed. We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other. The minimum that’s asked of you in such a collaborative culture is to come to the work everyday prepared to do whatever it takes to help shape the future of the organization as we strive to live our mission and vision\!

5. ### **OWL COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP**

At Open Way Learning, leadership is not tied to titles, it’s embedded in how we work, share decisions, and advance our mission together. Inspired by open-source principles of transparency, adaptability, inclusivity, and shared responsibility, OWL operates using a collective leadership model that empowers all team members to lead in their roles, contribute to strategic decisions, and take ownership of execution.

This approach is both a culture and a structure, designed to ensure that our work remains mission-aligned, human-centered, and responsive in a rapidly changing education landscape.

Unlike conventional hierarchies or top-down management, OWL’s collective leadership model is rooted in the belief that distributed, informed decision-making leads to better, faster, and more sustainable outcomes. Here's how it differs:

* Decentralized Authority with Shared Accountability: Leadership is distributed across the team, but grounded in clarity of roles and responsibilities. Everyone is empowered to lead where they are, within the boundaries of our mission, strategic goals, and the RACI framework (see below).  
* Open Access to Information: Instead of relying on gatekeepers, we invest in systems (like our Employee Handbook, SOPs, shared drives, and Productive) to ensure retrieval of knowledge is fast and accessible to all—allowing anyone to step in with clarity and confidence.  
* Bias for Action & Learning: We prioritize many informed decisions over perfect consensus, embracing iteration, reflection, and rapid feedback as a means of learning and improving together.

#### **Key Pillars of Collective Leadership at OWL:**

* Mission-Driven Decision Making \- Every decision starts with one question: Does this align with our mission, vision, values, and current strategic goals? If not, the decision must be escalated to the Director team or, if major, to the Board.  
* Radical Trust \- Trust is the currency of our culture. We assume positive intent, encourage open dialogue, and support each other in making good-faith decisions, even when the path is ambiguous. “Open” in OWL means transparent, respectful, and accountable.  
* Clarity \= Agility \- Role clarity (not control) enables quick and informed decisions. We rely on a living RACI Matrix to define who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed, and who plays a Support role across decisions. When ambiguity arises, we talk it through \- not around it.  
* Execution and Iteration \- Decisions must be followed by action—and action must be followed by reflection. Every decision sets a new baseline for learning. We operate in continuous beta, not perfection mode.  
* Feedback as a Leadership Act \- We normalize regular feedback (both formal and informal) as a form of care, alignment, and mutual respect. Constructive input and reflection are key leadership tools for everyone at OWL.  
* Shared Tools and Protocols \- We use a shared Decision-Making Protocol for complex or multi-stakeholder decisions. This includes:  
  * Define the problem  
  * Gather input  
  * Co-generate solutions  
  * Evaluate tradeoffs  
  * Decide  
  * Communicate clearly  
  * Reflect and improve  
    

  We also maintain a centralized Decision Log, regularly updated by our Manager of Operations to track key strategic and financial decisions.

#### **How This Shows Up in Our Work:**

* All Directors share responsibility for internal systems, program quality, partner relationships, and org-wide strategy. We meet weekly to raise, track, and resolve decisions collaboratively.  
* Staff and Fellows contribute to decision-making in their scope and are encouraged to suggest changes or identify gaps.  
* Ambiguous decisions are opportunities to build clarity—not power struggles. We identify leads and support roles quickly to avoid stalling.  
* Disagreements are handled with directness and care: raised peer-to-peer first, then escalated to the full Director team, and—only when necessary—to the Board Chair.

This model empowers everyone at OWL to contribute meaningfully to the mission—not just through ideas, but through decisions and execution. It accelerates progress, builds internal leadership capacity, and ensures our clients and communities benefit from a nimble, human-centered organization that models the kind of leadership we hope to see in schools.

For more on the tools, processes, and responsibilities tied to OWL’s collective leadership model, refer to the [Collective Leadership SOP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19iW5Q-XKk6P9aYqBYttqXBbXAY9IQz_kgZdPv_AfFQI/edit?usp=sharing).

6. ### **WORKING IN “*THE OPEN SOURCE* *WAY”* AT OWL**

The “open” in Open Way Learning is rooted in our core philosophy of “working in the open source way” \- an ethos that shapes how we collaborate, create, and contribute, both internally and externally. While our collective leadership model empowers everyone to make mission-aligned decisions, our open source mindset shapes how we share knowledge, build tools, and iterate together in public view.

This mindset stems from open source principles of transparency, collaboration, meritocracy, iteration, and community and explicitly shows up in how we:

* Contribute early and often, sharing MVPs (minimum viable products) before they’re perfect.  
* Prioritize working in the open (shared docs, recorded knowledge, version control).  
* Share drafts for community input, rather than waiting for top-down approval.  
* Invite contributions from anyone—not just those with tenure or titles.  
* Focus on outcomes and impact, not hours clocked or formal hierarchy\*.  
  *\* A note on “Focusing on Outcomes and Impact” \- While we value results and trust team members to manage their time independently, this principle should not be confused with a culture of overwork, perfectionism, or dismissing the value of effort. We recognize that meaningful progress often comes from process, relationship-building, and iteration, even when the final product is still emerging. This value simply reinforces our belief that impactful contributions matter more than visible busyness. It aligns with our flexible PTO policy and anti-burnout culture. We encourage everyone to take time off, recharge, and ask for support, because sustainable impact depends on sustainable people.*

Working this way means:

* You’re empowered to try something new, fail forward\*, and improve quickly.  
* You should always default to openness in communication, file sharing, and knowledge creation.  
* You are encouraged to use and contribute back to open-source tools and projects where applicable.  
* You help us model this mindset for schools, communities, and partners we serve.

Pro Tip: An MVP must still meet high quality expectations that reflect OWL’s high professional standards before going “live” to an external partner or client. If you’re unsure whether something is “ready enough,” ask an OWL colleague for input.

\**Note on “Failing Forward”: We believe that failure \- when it’s safe, intentional, and reflective \- is a powerful tool for learning and innovation. As described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb9tjnJWu5g), not all failure is created equal. OWL encourages “intelligent failures”that result from well-reasoned, mission-aligned risks and iterative experimentation, not from negligence, avoidable mistakes, or patterns of underperformance (especially if it has potential to affect OWL’s reputation). If you're unsure whether a decision or action falls within that distinction, seek peer feedback or check in with a teammate or Director.*

Finally, our open-source ethos informs how we hire, organize, and grow:

* We value asynchronous work, flexible schedules, and distributed collaboration.  
* We hire from our networks and communities—prioritizing alignment and contribution over credentials.  
* We design compensation and performance expectations that reflect our primary customer base \- educators.  
* Writing down and recording knowledge (over verbal explanations).  
  *\*A note on why we document: As stated at the beginning of this Handbook, at OWL we honor multiple ways of knowing and sharing information, including verbal storytelling, visual media, and lived experience. That said, we intentionally default to written and openly accessible documentation as a core part of our open-source culture. This approach, inspired by organizations like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/our-handbook-is-open-source-heres-why/) and Red Hat, is not just about policies—it’s about transparency, collective memory, and equitable access. Writing things down (or recording them in searchable, shareable formats) ensures that knowledge isn’t gatekept by proximity, tenure, or personality. As such, this open Handbook is the living source code of OWL \- a way to include all voices, adapt with feedback, and ensure everyone can understand not just what we do, but why and how we do it. It’s how we stay aligned, inclusive, and agile as we grow.*

In essence, OWL is not just an open organization—we are an open-source movement in education. We don’t just use these values \- we live them.

7. ### **HOW WE WORK WITH CLIENTS \- CORE PRACTICES & PRIORITIES:**

Open Way Learning’s core purpose is to help education practitioners bring cultures of learner-centered innovation to life within their own communities. We do this through workshops, design sprints, coaching, and other customized support grounded in Human-Centered Design and guided by the principles in our [Experiential Learning Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12v1Xnc22Z3WRI-9DGxuBDbEayVxb-ov-ydEMm3ndQTg/edit?usp=sharing).

We never provide canned, one-size-fits-all professional development. Every interaction, whether face-to-face, virtual, or hybrid, is co-designed with the client to meet local goals and leverage existing strengths, talents, and assets. We focus not just on short-term capacity building, but on seeding long-term systems change that is locally sustained and network-supported.

To ensure quality and consistency across all OWL engagements, we follow a set of guiding practices organized below into three tiers:

#### **Tier 1: Non-Negotiables (Always Present in Every Client Interaction):**

These are foundational elements of all OWL-facilitated work and should be evident in every engagement, regardless of context or scope:

* Co-design with client to ensure contextual relevance and shared ownership  
* Clear alignment to client-defined goals and assets (no “one-size-fits-all”)  
* Modeling of learner-centered practices (active learning, inquiry, voice & choice)  
* Evidence of design thinking as a guiding framework  
* Start and end on time (honoring participant time and presence)  
* Intentional space for participant reflection and self-assessment  
* Structured time for participants to apply learning to local context  
* Active efforts to build trust, psychological safety, and inclusion  
* Integration of local culture, language, and expertise  
* "Less is more" approach – minimum essential content to maximize impact  
* Focus on long-term systems thinking (never quick fixes)

#### **Tier 2: Strongly Encouraged Best Practices (Context Dependent):**

These elements should be included whenever possible and tailored to the specific audience, format, or duration of the engagement:

* “Show, don’t tell” modeling of activities and protocols  
* Use of mixed learning structures (whole group, small group, independent)  
* Intentional grouping strategies to maximize idea diversity and collaboration  
* Frequent feedback loops and opportunities to pivot in real-time  
* “Accordion” agendas with built-in flexibility and clear deliverables  
* Participant-generated norms, revisited throughout the session  
* Use of local data, examples, or artifacts to ground the work  
* High-quality exemplars, scaffolded work time, and checkpoints  
* Personalized coaching or breakout support for participants who need it  
* Integration of community and student voices (when appropriate)  
* Modeling critique, revision, and prototyping (“skateboard-to-car” mindset)  
* End the experience with a clear, emotionally resonant crescendo

#### **Tier 3: Value-Added Enhancements (When Time/Resources Allow):**

These elevate the participant experience and deepen impact but may depend on logistics, time, or budget:

* Incorporation of brain/body breaks (especially in full-day sessions)  
* Public products, exhibitions, or authentic audience feedback  
* Use of digital tools or tech-enhanced collaboration spaces  
* Optional pre/post reflection journaling or discussion protocols  
* Follow-up support (e.g., office hours, coaching touchpoints)  
* Collaborative resource building (shared documents, templates, playlists)  
* Cross-site networking with other schools, districts, or thought leaders  
* Opportunities to participate in OWL’s national network of learner-centered innovators

#### **Why This Matters \- Invest in Building Relationships for the Long-Term:**

Each OWL engagement is designed to catalyze not just individual change, but schoolwide transformation. We aim to build the capacity of clients to carry the work forward without us \- rooted in *local ownership*, *collaborative networks*, and a culture of ongoing reflection and experimentation.

This is why we embrace a “go slow to go fast” philosophy. Rather than rushing to scale, we focus on prototyping, feedback, and iteration—creating the conditions for long-term success and sustainability. When paired with strong internal culture and psychological safety, this approach empowers teams to *fail forward* in a safe, supported way.

8. ### **PROJECT MANAGEMENT & CLIENT-FACING WORK**

Every OWL project progresses through several key phases, each with specific responsibilities. This workflow applies to both employees and contracted OWL Fellows and is consistent with the procedures outlined in the OWL Contractor Manual.

PHASE 1: Project Launch: 

* A client contract is developed, often informed by a prior intake process or proposal.  
* The contract includes a formal Statement of Work (SOW) that outlines deliverables, timeline, scope, and key personnel.  
* An OWL Project Manager (Primary Contact) is designated, along with a Secondary Contact for redundancy and continuity.  
* For projects involving OWL Fellows, a matching Contractor Scope of Work is issued per the independent contractor agreement.

PHASE 2: Planning & Co-Design:

* The Primary Contact schedules a client intake meeting and additional co-design sessions, often using OWL’s 5P Protocol: *Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance.*  
* The Secondary Contact participates in planning and remains updated on key deliverables, logistics, and decisions to ensure they can step in if needed.  
* Project materials are developed collaboratively and stored in shared OWL folders per the operating guidelines and open-source licensing practices.  
* The Primary Contact confirms responsibilities for any OWL Fellow (e.g., workshop content, tech tools, anchor docs) and ensures alignment with OWL values and brand.   
* During this phase, use these guiding questions to vet Internal Drafts vs. External-Ready Documents:  
  * Is this a rough draft for internal team feedback? If yes, share internally only.  
  * Have the client’s goals, scope, and timeline been collaboratively defined? If yes, the draft is ready for external review.  
  * Is the budget or rate finalized and approved by the OWL Leadership Team? If yes, then and only then include financial details.   
  * Note: When in doubt, label drafts as INTERNAL WORKING DOCUMENT and clarify what input is being requested.

PHASE 3: Delivery of Services:

* OWL Fellows or staff facilitators carry out the sessions (workshops, coaching, etc.) as defined in the Scope of Work.  
* The Primary Contact supports quality assurance by checking in with the client and facilitator(s), offering day-of support if needed.  
* All participants are expected to model OWL’s facilitation values: learner-centered, inclusive, inquiry-driven, and feedback-responsive.

PHASE 4: Follow-Up & Reflection:

* A post-session check-in is initiated by the Primary Contact, which may include a client survey, delivery of session artifacts, and recommendations for next steps.  
* OWL Fellows submit a short trip report or debrief reflection, highlighting strengths, challenges, and suggested pivots.  
* The Primary Contact reviews client feedback and shares growth-oriented notes with the facilitation team.  
* If appropriate, the project is archived and lessons are added to OWL’s internal knowledge-sharing systems.

#### **Key Responsibilities by Role:**

* Primary Contact (Project Lead)  
  * Owns the full scope of the project and serves as the main liaison between the client and OWL team.  
  * Coordinates all planning, co-design, and logistics for the engagement.  
  * Ensures all deliverables align with the Statement of Work and OWL quality standards.  
  * Communicates any changes, risks, or client concerns to internal leadership.  
  * Collaborates with OWL Fellows and staff to model shared leadership while maintaining accountability.  
* Secondary Contact (Support & Continuity)  
  * Maintains awareness of all aspects of the project.  
  * Holds periodic check-ins with the Primary Contact to ensure readiness to step in if needed.  
  * May serve as a sounding board, coach, or design partner throughout the engagement.  
  * Steps in as lead if the Primary Contact is unavailable, ensuring seamless coverage.

#### **Final Notes:**

* All project personnel must ensure that work remains within the scope of the client contract or contractor SOW.  
* Any significant changes in service dates, deliverables, or facilitator roles must be approved by the Primary Contact and documented in writing.  
* OWL strives for transparency and continuous improvement; feedback from all parties \- clients, Fellows, and internal staff \- is not just welcomed but expected.  
* For detailed role definitions, invoicing requirements, and facilitator expectations whenever external engagements involve OWL fellows (contractors), refer to the [OWL Contractor Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Amx9PrVgE3YQ2YhXsfH4TOxkXTS-tWJ6AqV4QoSC7j0/edit?usp=sharing).


9. ### **SUSTAINING AN AGILE, STARTUP MINDSET AS WE GROW**

   

As OWL expands our reach and impact, we are committed to staying agile, open, and focused—not slow, bureaucratic, or overly hierarchical. We draw inspiration from models like Kotter’s Dual Operating System, which remind us that an organization can run like a scaling company and a nimble startup at the same time—if it intentionally supports both. This balance helps us:

* Move quickly on opportunities;  
* Iterate with confidence;  
* Maintain quality and consistency as we grow;  
* Stay grounded in purpose, not process.

We call this our startup mindset, and it’s a conscious choice \- not something that just “happens.” It’s what lets us remain true to our mission while adapting to a changing education landscape.


#### **What This Looks Like at OWL**

Maintaining this mindset means everyone on the team is empowered to contribute \- not just to their individual work, but to how OWL works as an organization. Here’s how we practice this ethos:

* Actively recruit team members who thrive in open, non-hierarchical environments built on trust, transparency, and collective leadership.  
* Use lightweight, flexible tools and workflows such as Agile check-ins, Kanban boards, “scrum-style” collaborations, and project-based swarms to move fast and adapt quickly.  
* Hire for purpose and potential, and support autonomy through meaningful compensation, flexible schedules, and a clear connection to impact.  
* Say no to the wrong work \- even if the price tag is tempting \- when it doesn’t align with our mission or values.  
* Default to transparency, sharing information openly inside and outside the org whenever possible.  
* Empower people to understand the “why” behind decisions and tasks. If it’s not clear, ask. If it could be improved, speak up.  
* Treat this Handbook as a living document \- a reference, not a rulebook. Use it to move faster, not to ask for permission.  
* *Go slow to go fast* by investing in clarity, culture, and alignment early so that our work scales meaningfully and sustainably.

In short, we believe that staying lean and curious makes us more creative, more collaborative, and more impactful. And we know that the best ideas often come from the edges, not the center. As we scale, we grow stronger and smarter, not more rigid.

**Agile tools we use (and why they matter)**

We adopt lean, startup-inspired practices not because it’s trendy, but because it helps us stay true to our culture and mission. This includes:

* Staying aligned without unnecessary meetings  
* Making our work visible (and finish what we start)  
* Moving quickly when the opportunity is right  
* Course-corrections without drama  
* Protecting quality and avoiding burnout  
* Meeting commitments, including starting and ending on time

Here’s how we live that out:

| Tool/Practice | What It Is | Why OWL Uses It |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Weekly Scrums** | Fast, structured team check-ins (45 \- 60 min) | Ensure clarity on top priorities, blockers, and cross-team needs |
| **Kanban Boards** | Visual boards that track work by stage | Help everyone see progress, reduce bottlenecks, stay accountable |
| **Swarms** | Temporary “micro-teams” for urgent tasks | Activate the right people at the right time \- fast and focused |
| **Timeboxing** | Setting limits for tasks or decisions | Prevent perfectionism (embracing the idea of non-closure); focus on meaningful progress |
| **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)** | Start small, improve over time | Test early, learn fast, refine with feedback |
| **“Go Slow to Go Fast”** | Invest early in alignment, clarity, and relationships | We build trust, surface hidden assumptions, and reduce rework by slowing down at the start—so we can move faster, smarter, and more sustainably later on |
| **Postmortems & Retros** | Structured reflection and debrief after key events | Normalize learning from failure and celebrate wins |
| **Async-first communication** | Slack \+ Productive \+ shared docs | Respect time zones and focus, reduce meeting overload |
