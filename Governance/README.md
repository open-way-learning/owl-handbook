# üß≠ Governance Overview

This section of the OWL Handbook provides public access to the foundational governance documents that define how Open Way Learning (OWL) operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. These resources clarify the **legal, ethical, and organizational framework** that underpins both Board-level oversight and our distributed, mission-aligned leadership culture.

## üîë Governance Philosophy

OWL maintains a **dual governance model** that reflects both nonprofit best practices and our open-source values. This means we:

- Honor traditional board responsibilities‚Äîlegal, fiduciary, and strategic‚Äîguided by our Bylaws and IRS regulations.
- Empower a **collective leadership team** to make informed, transparent decisions aligned to mission, vision, and strategic priorities (see [`About OWL`](../Employee_Handbook/About%20OWL.md)).

This structure is not a compromise‚Äîit‚Äôs a commitment to **shared accountability** and high-integrity leadership, balancing compliance with the agility required to serve educators and students well.

## üîÅ Updating Governance Documents

Most governance documents (e.g. Bylaws, Board Ethics) require a formal Board vote to be amended. All updates must follow OWL‚Äôs **two-reading amendment process** as outlined in the Bylaws. Operational governance documents (e.g. Code of Ethics, Org Chart) may be updated by the Leadership Team with Board awareness.
