# OWL Governance

{% hint style="info" %}
**Owner:** Director of Orgazational Strategy & Learning (DOSL) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff, partners, and stakeholders
{% endhint %}

## Purpose

This section of the OWL Handbook provides public access to the foundational governance documents that define how Open Way Learning operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

These resources clarify the **legal, ethical, and organizational framework** that underpins both Board-level oversight and our distributed, mission-aligned leadership culture.

> **Looking for how the leadership team operates day-to-day?**  
> See our **Collective Leadership SOP (Quickstart + Decision Ladder/RACI-S)**, the **Common Roles & Responsibilities for All Directors**, and **Role READMEs** (DPD, DPIV, D-OSL) for the lightweight norms we use to decide, deliver, and improve together.

## Governance Philosophy

OWL maintains a **dual governance model** that reflects both nonprofit best practices and our open-source values. This means we:

- Honor traditional board responsibilities—legal, fiduciary, and strategic—guided by our Bylaws and IRS regulations.
- Empower a **collective leadership team** to make informed, transparent decisions aligned to mission, vision, and strategic priorities (see [About OWL](../About-OWL/README.md)).

This structure is not a compromise—it's a commitment to **shared accountability** and high-integrity leadership, balancing compliance with the agility required to serve educators and students well.

## What you'll find in this section

### 1. Open Way Learning Bylaws
**What It Is:**  
The official governing document outlining the legal structure, board responsibilities, quorum and voting procedures, officer roles, conflict of interest provisions, and amendment processes.

**Why It Matters:**  
This document defines how OWL remains legally compliant and mission-aligned. It is required by law and periodically reviewed and amended by the Board.

### 2. IRS Determination Letter  
**What It Is:**  
The official letter from the IRS confirming OWL's status as a tax-exempt nonprofit under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

**Why It Matters:**  
Provides legal proof of exemption, necessary for compliance, fundraising, donor contributions, and eligibility for grants or public funding.

### 3. Organizational Chart
**What It Is:**  
A current map of OWL's internal staffing roles and reporting relationships—spanning the Leadership Team, employees, and the Board of Directors

**Why It Matters:**  
Illustrates how OWL distributes authority, aligns responsibilities, and ensures clarity between organizational units.

### 4. OWL Code of Ethics
**What It Is:**  
A comprehensive guide outlining the ethical expectations for all OWL team members—employees, fellows, and volunteers—including standards for conflict of interest, confidentiality, use of funds, and public integrity.

**Why It Matters:**  
This document reinforces our collective responsibility to model the values we promote in schools: integrity, transparency, and equity.

### 5. Board of Directors Code of Ethics
**What It Is:**  
A specific ethical framework for Board members, addressing fiduciary duty, conflict of interest, financial oversight, and responsible governance.

**Why It Matters:**  
Clarifies the distinct ethical responsibilities of Board members in their fiduciary role and supports alignment between governance and mission.

## How These Pieces Fit Together

| Document | Focus Area | Maintained By | Relevant Audience |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Bylaws | Legal governance, structure | Board of Directors | All stakeholders |
| IRS Letter | Tax status & eligibility | Leadership Team, Treasurer | Funders, auditors, public |
| Org Chart | Internal staffing structure | Leadership Team | OWL employees |
| OWL Code of Ethics | Day-to-day expectations | All employees, contractors | Staff, fellows, Board |
| Board Code of Ethics | Board-specific conduct | Board Chair | Board members |
| Collective Leadership SOP | Decision Ladder, RACI-S, #decision_log, scrum | Leadership Team (D-OSL steward) | OWL employees, Board (awareness) |
| Common R&R (All Directors) | Shared director responsibilities & guardrails | Leadership Team (D-OSL steward) | Directors, PMs |
| Role READMEs (DPD/DPIV/D-OSL) | Role overviews with links to canonical R&R | Each Role Owner (Director) | Staff, fellows, partners (as relevant) |

## Leadership Operating Documents (Collective Leadership)

These materials codify how OWL’s distributed leadership works in practice—clear decision rights, lightweight rituals, and shared operating discipline.

- **Collective Leadership SOP (Quickstart + Decision Ladder/RACI-S)** — the bedrock for decisions, #decision_log, scrum cadence, and operating discipline.
- **Common Roles & Responsibilities for All Directors** — the shared layer every Director inherits (ROI Guardrail, monthly “earn your keep,” comms/status pattern, KPI cadence).
- **Roles Directory (READMEs)** — concise overviews for each Director role with links to the canonical Google Docs:
  - Director of Finance & Operations (**DFO**)
  - Director of Program Impact & Visibility (**DPIV**)
  - Director of Organizational Strategy & Learning (**D-OSL**)

## Updating Governance Documents

Most governance documents (e.g. Bylaws, Board Ethics) require a formal Board vote to be amended. All updates must follow OWL's **two-reading amendment process** as outlined in the Bylaws. Operational governance documents (e.g. Code of Ethics, Org Chart) may be updated by the Leadership Team with Board awareness.
**Leadership Operating Docs (OWL's Collective Leadership Procedure, Role & Responsibility Docs for each Director, READMEs).**  
These are living documents maintained via PRs in this repo and the canonical Google Docs they reference. Changes follow this flow:
1) Propose/update in the **canonical Google Doc** (role owner) and create a **#decision_log** entry.
2) Open a **PR** mirroring the approved change in the README/SOP here; link the #decision_log entry.
3) **Review/merge** by the steward (D-OSL) and relevant role owner; update the “last_reviewed” field.
