2. Surplus Fund (Rainy Day Fund) – Designed to cover strategic needs beyond routine operations.  
   * Target range: 3-6 months of expenses  
   * At least 50% of surplus funds must be allocated here if below target before funding other priorities.  
3. Operating Reserves – Cash on hand to cover routine operations.  
   * Minimum target: 6 months of average operating expenses  
   * Surplus allocations may be made to replenish reserves if needed.  
4. Employee Compensation & Bonuses:  
   * Refer to the OWL Compensation Guidelines for details regarding bonuses.  
5. Strategic Investments – Remaining funds may be allocated to mission- aligned initiatives such as:  
   * Infrastructure improvements  
   * Professional development  
   * Research and development  
   * Partnerships with aligned organizations  
3. Governance & Oversight:  
* The Treasurer calculates and reports Surplus Fund and Operating Reserve levels annually.  
* The Board reviews and approves fund allocations based on financial trends and mission priorities.  
* Budget Development & Approval:  
  * The Leadership Team drafts the annual budget based on projected income and organizational needs.  
  * The Treasurer reviews the budget before submission to the Board for final approval per OWL’s Bylaws.  
* Transparency & Accountability:  
  * The approved budget is shared with all employees.  
  * Surplus allocation decisions are documented in Board minutes and overseen by the Board Chair.
