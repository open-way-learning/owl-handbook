## Article II: Purpose

Section 1: Open Way Learning has been deemed by the United States Internal Revenue Service as being an education nonprofit per [Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501c3). Its Employer Identification Number issued by the IRS is 83-3760449.

Section 2: The Organization is organized under the [North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act](https://www.ncleg.gov/Laws/GeneralStatuteSections/Chapter55A) (herein known as "the Act"), and shall operate exclusively for charitable and educational purposes and in a manner consistent with [Chapter 55A of the General Statutes of North Carolina](https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_55a.html). 

Section 3: The purpose of Open Way Learning is to partner with schools, districts, and education organizations to co-design and sustain cultures of learner-centered innovation. These efforts prioritize equitably empowering students, especially those historically furthest from opportunity, to thrive in a rapidly changing world, fostering durable success skills, lifelong agency, and a love of learning.

Section 4: Open Way Learning’s mission is to co-design ways to amplify the joy & wonder of learning for every student. Open Way Learning’s vision is that all learners can change their world \- innovative schools empower that change to happen, now\!

Section 5: OWL’s Core Beliefs:

* Authentic innovation arises not from transient, "buzzword strategies," but from intentional, sustained efforts to foster a school culture where continuous improvement and innovation thrive.  
* Cultures of innovation flourish when rooted in the Open Way Learning elements: a living, shared vision; collective leadership; radical collaboration; and the free and open exchange of ideas and resources. These elements empower meaningful teaching and learning for all students, especially those furthest from opportunity.  
* Every school and district possesses the talent and skills necessary to cultivate innovation. By embracing transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—the principles of "the open-source way"—schools can catalyze positive disruption and prepare students for a dynamic and interconnected world.

Section 6: Open Way Learning advances its mission through open, equitable, and innovative teaching and learning strategies grounded in research and proven practices. These include, but are not limited to:

* Experiential Learning: Hands-on, real-world projects and problem-solving that foster deep, interdisciplinary understanding.  
* Competency-Based Education: Personalized learning paths where mastery, rather than time, dictates progress.  
* Design Thinking: A structured, iterative approach to creative, human-centered problem-solving.  
* Distributed Leadership: Empowering educators and students to share decision-making and drive systemic improvement.  
* Personalized Learning: Tailored educational experiences that align with individual strengths, interests, assets, and needs.

Section 7: Open Way Learning delivers the above strategies through a variety of face-to-face and virtual interactions, including, but not limited to school-based workshops, targeted coaching and co-design, school study visits, design sprints, conference presentations, and strategic partnerships with like-minded organizations.

Section 8: Open Way Learning funds and supports the above activities primarily through fee-for-service (e.g., workshop participant fees, service contracts, conference fees, etc.) and direct or indirect grants. Other funding sources include speaking honoraria, donations, and sponsorships. 

Section 9: OWL is committed to helping close the unacceptable equity gap that has existed for far too long in educational systems and institutions by prioritizing and significantly discounting service to historically marginalized and high-need schools and communities, as well as aligning resources to maximize impact in areas of greatest need.
