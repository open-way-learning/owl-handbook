# Our Approach (The What and How)

## What We Do

OWL works directly with schools, districts, networks, and education partners to bring our beliefs to life through experiential learning strategies and schoolwide systems change. Our support is always:

* Co-designed with those we serve  
* Customized to local needs, assets, and goals  
* Sustained through coaching, reflection, and iteration  
* Centered on equity and belonging—especially for those most underserved by traditional models

We specialize in helping communities adopt and adapt practices such as:

* Experiential Learning, including Project-, Problem-, Place-, Phenomenon-, and Profession-Based Learning  
* Design Thinking & Strategic Planning  
* Competency-Based and Mastery Learning  
* Advisory Programs and Crew Models  
* STEM, STEAM, and Makerspace integration  
* Community-facing partnerships and policy advocacy

We do this through design sprints, workshops, coaching, school visits, conferences, virtual courses, and open-source resource sharing—all guided by our belief that real innovation grows from trust, agency, and reflection.

## **SMART GROWTH \> FAST GROWTH**

Open Way Learning also believes that real change doesn’t come from scaling faster, it comes from scaling wiser. That’s why we pursue smart growth: a commitment to growing in ways that strengthen our values, deepen our impact, and preserve the uniquely human, learner-centered approach that defines who we are as an education nonprofit. We do not exist to become big for the sake of being big. Our goal is also not to saturate the market with one-size-fits-all programs, but to build capacity for schools to lead their own transformation—anchored in culture, relationships, and trust.

Growth for us means growing our ability to go deep, not just wide. We take on new work only when we’re confident we can deliver at the level of quality and partnership that school communities deserve. This includes adapting to local context, investing in co-design, and ensuring our efforts leave behind lasting conditions for continuous improvement (vs. lots of one-off workshops).

As education scholar Jal Mehta writes in [*In Search of Deeper Learning*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674248250), real innovation requires time, trust, and cultural commitment \- not replication at scale. He writes, “The deepest learning tends to occur in the places where students and teachers are part of strong cultures, where adults collaborate around shared purpose, and where experimentation and reflection are valued.” These same conditions equally apply to how we want to grow as an organization.

*In short: We scale trust. We scale culture. We scale impact. And we never scale at the expense of depth.*

This is the throughline in all our work, and a key reason we’ve earned a reputation for doing what many consider hard to do in education: combining vision with the discipline to make it real.

## **HOW WE WORK WITH CLIENTS \- CORE PRACTICES & PRIORITIES:**

Open Way Learning’s core purpose is to help education practitioners bring cultures of learner-centered innovation to life within their own communities. We do this through workshops, design sprints, coaching, and other customized support grounded in Human-Centered Design and guided by the principles in our [Experiential Learning Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12v1Xnc22Z3WRI-9DGxuBDbEayVxb-ov-ydEMm3ndQTg/edit?usp=sharing).

We never provide canned, one-size-fits-all professional development. Every interaction, whether face-to-face, virtual, or hybrid, is co-designed with the client to meet local goals and leverage existing strengths, talents, and assets. We focus not just on short-term capacity building, but on seeding long-term systems change that is locally sustained and network-supported.

To ensure quality and consistency across all OWL engagements, we follow a set of guiding practices organized below into three tiers:

#### **Tier 1: Non-Negotiables (Always Present in Every Client Interaction):**

These are foundational elements of all OWL-facilitated work and should be evident in every engagement, regardless of context or scope:

* Co-design with client to ensure contextual relevance and shared ownership  
* Clear alignment to client-defined goals and assets (no “one-size-fits-all”)  
* Modeling of learner-centered practices (active learning, inquiry, voice & choice)  
* Evidence of design thinking as a guiding framework  
* Start and end on time (honoring participant time and presence)  
* Intentional space for participant reflection and self-assessment  
* Structured time for participants to apply learning to local context  
* Active efforts to build trust, psychological safety, and inclusion  
* Integration of local culture, language, and expertise  
* "Less is more" approach – minimum essential content to maximize impact  
* Focus on long-term systems thinking (never quick fixes)

### **Tier 2: Strongly Encouraged Best Practices (Context Dependent):**

These elements should be included whenever possible and tailored to the specific audience, format, or duration of the engagement:

* “Show, don’t tell” modeling of activities and protocols  
* Use of mixed learning structures (whole group, small group, independent)  
* Intentional grouping strategies to maximize idea diversity and collaboration  
* Frequent feedback loops and opportunities to pivot in real-time  
* “Accordion” agendas with built-in flexibility and clear deliverables  
* Participant-generated norms, revisited throughout the session  
* Use of local data, examples, or artifacts to ground the work  
* High-quality exemplars, scaffolded work time, and checkpoints  
* Personalized coaching or breakout support for participants who need it  
* Integration of community and student voices (when appropriate)  
* Modeling critique, revision, and prototyping (“skateboard-to-car” mindset)  
* End the experience with a clear, emotionally resonant crescendo

### **Tier 3: Value-Added Enhancements (When Time/Resources Allow):**

These elevate the participant experience and deepen impact but may depend on logistics, time, or budget:

* Incorporation of brain/body breaks (especially in full-day sessions)  
* Public products, exhibitions, or authentic audience feedback  
* Use of digital tools or tech-enhanced collaboration spaces  
* Optional pre/post reflection journaling or discussion protocols  
* Follow-up support (e.g., office hours, coaching touchpoints)  
* Collaborative resource building (shared documents, templates, playlists)  
* Cross-site networking with other schools, districts, or thought leaders  
* Opportunities to participate in OWL’s national network of learner-centered innovators

### **Why This Matters \- Invest in Building Relationships for the Long-Term:**

Each OWL engagement is designed to catalyze not just individual change, but schoolwide transformation. We aim to build the capacity of clients to carry the work forward without us \- rooted in *local ownership*, *collaborative networks*, and a culture of ongoing reflection and experimentation.

This is why we embrace a “go slow to go fast” philosophy. Rather than rushing to scale, we focus on prototyping, feedback, and iteration—creating the conditions for long-term success and sustainability. When paired with strong internal culture and psychological safety, this approach empowers teams to *fail forward* in a safe, supported way.
