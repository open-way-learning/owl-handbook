## Purpose (what this role exists to achieve)
Grow OWL’s mission and financial health by cultivating strategic partnerships, grants, and contracts—turning evidence of impact into sustainable revenue—while keeping opportunities aligned with capacity, guardrails, and our learner-centered values.

## What success looks like (core outcomes)
- **Healthy pipeline:** Predictable flow of qualified opportunities → proposals → wins → renewals.
- **Mission-fit partnerships:** MOUs/terms that strengthen programs, visibility, and sustainability.
- **Evidence-driven development:** Impact artifacts (Bright Spots/Proof Points) power grants and storytelling.
- **Financial discipline:** ROI Guardrail applied to every deal; no surprise scope or margin erosion.

## Decision rights & guardrails (snapshot)
- **One “A” rule:** DFO is **Accountable** for pricing/go-no-go, proposals/grants, budget/compliance, and revenue forecasts; **Consulted** = D-OSL (mission/precedent and strategic MOUs), DPIV (program/story).
- **ROI Guardrail:** Commit only if **deposit in hand**, **≥minimum margin**, **pass-throughs matched to receipts**, **or** there’s a **funded path ≤90 days**; otherwise log an explicit strategic exception.
- **Logging:** Post Strategic/Tactical outcomes in **#decision_log** (3–5 lines: summary, RACI-S, why it matters, next step, link).

## Scope of work (high-signal summary)
- **Pipeline & Partnerships:** Qualify, prioritize, and steward funders/partners; maintain CRM and 90-day forecast.
- **Grants & Proposals:** Lead narrative, budget coordination (with DFIO), compliance attachments, and submission.
- **Strategic MOUs:** Vet mission fit, roles/decision rights, data/privacy, brand/comms, and financial terms.
- **Fellows/Contractors (development context):** Source talent, co-design scopes with PMs, and mentor where relevant.
- **Evaluation & Storytelling (with DPIV):** Translate program evidence into compelling, funder-ready narratives.

## Interfaces (who you co-design with)
- **DFO — Finance & Internal Ops:** Pricing, budgets, compliance, contracts/insurance, invoicing cadence.
- **DPIV — Program Impact & Visibility:** Program alignment, artifacts, public comms/campaigns tied to development.
- **D-OSL — Strategy & Learning:** Mission/precedent checks, adoption of dev systems/process, board-visible items.
- **PMs — Site Delivery:** Local scoping, capacity checks, letters/MOUs, and on-the-ground relationship intel.

## KPIs & review cadence
- **Weekly:** Pipeline moves (new → qualified → propose → commit), go/no-go calls, revenue/capacity risks.
- **Monthly:** Development Dashboard (deposits received/forecast, 90-day outlook, grant burn/requirements, partner health).
- **Quarterly:** Win rate by stage, renewal rate, average days to close, margin health of wins, “what we learned” memo.

## Operating discipline (always)
Use Slack for essential comms; keep Productive cards current; maintain file/CRM hygiene; submit receipts/billables promptly; keep calendar accurate (include “sub plan” when OOO); status format: **Here’s where we are → Here’s the gap → Here’s the next step.**

## Director-as-PM expectation (when applicable)
When serving as PM for non-WNCRP work, **earn your keep**: cover salary (and attributable overhead) **monthly** through billable service and/or funded grants/contracts in your portfolio.

## RACI-S snapshot (common calls)
- **Grant/Proposal Submission:** **A = DPD**, R = DPD, C = DFIO/D-OSL/DPIV, I = Team (Board if material).
- **Strategic Partnership (MOU):** **A = DPD**, R = DPD, C = DFIO (terms/compliance), D-OSL (mission/precedent), DPIV (program/brand), I = Team/Board if material.
- **Pricing / Go-No-Go:** **A = DPD**, C = DFIO (margin/cash), D-OSL (guardrails/precedent), PM (delivery feasibility).
