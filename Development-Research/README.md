# Development & Research

This section houses documents and tools related to OWL’s fundraising, grant development, contractor and Fellow engagement, and field-based program evaluation.

It is actively maintained by the **Director of Development & Research**, who serves as the steward of this folder. Any proposed changes should be reviewed and approved by this Director to ensure alignment with OWL’s strategic priorities and external-facing commitments.

This folder focuses on the **financial sustainability, evaluation capacity, and research partnerships** that support OWL’s growth and mission delivery. While it may overlap with `Strategy-Innovation/`—which focuses on innovation systems, internal learning cycles, and forward-looking design—this section emphasizes externally validated practices, formal evaluations, and structured partnerships that often emerge through grant-funded or contracted work.

Key responsibilities connected to this section include:

- Leading **grant writing**, proposal development, and funder relationship management  
- Maintaining a **development calendar** to track proposals, deadlines, and compliance  
- Designing and overseeing the **OWL Fellows Program**, including recruitment and mentoring  
- Managing **short-term contractors**, contracts, and scopes of work  
- Coordinating **impact evaluation** practices for grant-funded projects  
- Building and sustaining **research partnerships** with universities, nonprofits, and foundations  
- Integrating research and program evaluation into OWL’s development strategy and storytelling  
- Aligning fundraising strategy with programmatic, operational, and financial systems

This folder interfaces closely with:
- `Outreach-Programming/` (for program delivery alignment and storytelling)
- `Operations-Finance/` (for budget tracking and compliance)
- `Strategy-Innovation/` (for internal learning, R&D, and innovation systems)
- `Administration-HR/` (for contractor onboarding and capacity building)

Refer to OWL’s [Organizational Chart](../Governance/org-chart.pdf) for current role assignments or contact any OWL Director for clarification.
