NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations of the parties set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

2. Effective Date and Termination.  This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date, and shall be automatically renewed on an annualized basis, unless terminated earlier as provided in this Agreement (the “Term”).  This Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason upon fourteen (14) days prior written notice to the other party.  Notwithstanding the prior sentence, this Agreement may be terminated by Company immediately, with or without notice, should Contractor materially breach any of Contractor’s obligations set forth in this Agreement or if Contractor is unable to perform the Services by reason of illness, disability, incapacity or death.  Upon termination of this Agreement, Company shall have no further obligations to Contractor other than to pay for Services performed as of the date of termination.

7. Confidential Information.  For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean information not generally known to the public relating to Company’s business that is received, created, developed, conceived, or otherwise acquired or made by Contractor in connection with Contractor’s performance of Services for Company or prior employment with Company, regardless of whether it is in tangible or intangible form (including without limitation research methodology, procedures and techniques, client projects and client information, technical reports, communications, business plans, financial information, trade secrets, know-how, Intellectual Property Rights (defined below) and Work Product (defined below), and other documents, materials and information).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Confidential Information” shall not include information that Contractor can prove by written records to be received by Contractor from a third party not associated with Company and not subject to an obligation of confidentiality to Company.  Contractor agrees that Contractor shall not, directly or indirectly, use or disclose any Confidential Information for any purpose other than to the extent necessary to perform the Services.

8. Intellectual Property.  
   1) “Intellectual Property Rights” means all rights in and to US and foreign (i) patents, patent disclosures and inventions (whether patentable or not), (ii) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, logos, corporate names and domain names, and other similar designations of source or origin, together with the goodwill symbolized by any of the foregoing, (iii) copyrights and copyrightable works (including computer programs), mask works, and rights in data and databases, (iv) trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information, and (v) all other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all registrations and applications for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights, and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection in any part of the world.  
   2) “Work Product” means all writings, works of authorship, technology, inventions, discoveries, processes, techniques, methods, ideas, concepts, research, proposals, materials and all other work product of any nature whatsoever, that are created, prepared, produced, authored, edited, amended, conceived or reduced to practice by Contractor individually or jointly with others during the Term and relating in any way to the business or contemplated business, products, activities, research or development of Company or resulting from any work performed by Contractor for Company (in each case, regardless of when or where the work product is prepared or whose equipment or other resources is used in preparing the same), all rights and claims related to the foregoing, and all printed, physical and electronic copies and other tangible embodiments thereof.  
   3) Work Product.  Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to all Work Product, as well as any and all Intellectual Property Rights therein and all improvements thereof, shall be the sole and exclusive property of Company. The Work Product is and shall at all times remain the Confidential Information of Company.  Company shall have the unrestricted right to (A) use, commercialize, or market any Work Product, or (B) file an application for patent, copyright registration, or any other Intellectual Property Rights and prosecute or abandon such application prior to issuance or registration; provided that nothing herein requires Company to undertake the activities set forth in (A) or (B), and Company may elect, at its absolute discretion, not to do so. No royalty or other consideration shall be due or owing to Contractor now or in the future as a result of such activities.  
   4) Work Made for Hire; Assignment.  Contractor acknowledges that, by reason of being engaged by Company at the relevant times, to the extent permitted by law, all Work Product consisting of copyrightable subject matter is “work made for hire” as defined in the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. § 101), and such copyrights are therefore owned by Company. To the extent that the foregoing does not apply, Contractor hereby irrevocably assigns to Company, and its successors and assigns, for no additional consideration, Contractor’s entire right, title and interest in and to all Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights therein, including the right to sue, counterclaim and recover for all past, present and future infringement, misappropriation or dilution thereof, and all rights corresponding thereto throughout the world. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to reduce or limit Company’s rights, title or interest in any Work Product or Intellectual Property Rights so as to be less in any respect than Company would have had in the absence of this Agreement.  
   5) Further Assurances; Power of Attorney.  During and after the Term, Contractor agrees to reasonably cooperate with Company to (i) apply for, obtain, perfect and transfer to the Company the Work Product as well as any and all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product in any jurisdiction throughout the world, and (ii) maintain, protect, and enforce the same, including, without limitation, giving testimony and executing and delivering to Company any and all applications, oaths, declarations, affidavits, waivers, assignments and other documents and instruments as shall be requested by Company.  Contractor hereby irrevocably grants Company power of attorney to execute and deliver any such documents on Contractor's behalf in his name and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to transfer the Work Product to Company and further the transfer, prosecution, issuance and maintenance of all Intellectual Property Rights therein, to the full extent permitted by law, if Contractor does not promptly cooperate with Company’s request (without limiting the rights Company shall have in such circumstances by operation of law). This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by Contractor’s subsequent incapacity.  
   6) Moral rights.  To the extent any copyrights are assigned under this Section 8, Contractor hereby irrevocably waives in favor of Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any and all claims Contractor may now or hereafter have in any jurisdiction to all rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as “moral rights” in relation to all works of authorship to which the assigned copyrights apply.

9. Covenant Not to Solicit. During this term of this Agreement and for two (2) years following the termination of this Agreement for any reason, Contractor will not:  
   1) (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee of Company to leave Company’s employment, (ii) in any way interfere with the relationship between Company and any of their respective employees, (iii) employ, or otherwise engage as an employee, independent contractor or otherwise, any employee of Company, or (iv) induce or attempt to induce any supplier, past or current client, licensee, or business relation of Company to cease doing business with Company, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any supplier, past or current client, licensee, or business relation of Company;   
   2) (i) solicit, either themselves or through others, or assist any person in soliciting the business of any person or entity who is a current or recent (within the last 12 months of the conclusion of this Agreement) client of Company and with whom Contractor had material contact, (ii) encourage, cause, or assist any person in encouraging or causing, any potential client whose business was being solicited by Company within the twelve-month period preceding termination of this Agreement and with whom Contractor had material contact to dissuade such client prospectively from doing business with Company, or (iii) contract with any persons or entities who were clients of Company within the twelve-month period preceding the termination of this Agreement for the purpose of competing with Company.

10. Return of Company Property.  Upon the request of Company at any time or at the end of the Term, Contractor shall promptly (but in no event more than ten (10) days after written request by Company) return or provide to Company all Company property including but not limited to Confidential Information and Work Product, in any and all tangible forms (and all copies or notes thereof).

11. Assignment.  The rights, duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit and shall be binding upon their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Neither this Agreement nor the respective rights, duties, obligations and responsibilities of Contractor under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by Contractor to any other person, association, organization, company or other entity (including subcontractors) without the prior written consent of Company.

12. Survival.  The provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement shall continue as valid and enforceable obligations of the parties notwithstanding any such termination or non-renewal.


13. Choice of Law.  This Agreement, and any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall in all respects be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

    1) Contractor may refer to themself as an OWL Fellow for as long as Contractor is providing services for Company.   
    2) Contractor may place such designation on professional websites such as LinkedIn and may list this designation as part of Contractor’s chronological work history on CVs or resumes. Contractor may, on a non-commercial website, link to free materials or Creative Commons materials on OWL’s website if the Contractor provides proper attribution and with OWL’s prior written approval.

15. Miscellaneous.  Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, to any extent, be held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application thereof, other than those provisions held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby and shall continue valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law or equity.  No waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.  This Agreement represents the entire and integrated agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or oral regarding the subject matter thereof. This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed by both Company and Contractor.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement to be effective as of the date first above written.
