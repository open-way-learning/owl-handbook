### **OPEN WAY LEARNING** 

### **CONTRACTOR MANUAL**

## **Purpose:** 

This manual outlines the expectations, responsibilities, and best practices for individuals working with Open Way Learning (OWL) under its [Independent Contractor Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jcpmY8hDsiDyTqlCmG5KEyQHonmXM14fsKKIlSDBkbI/edit?usp=sharing) (ICA), particularly those recognized as OWL Fellows. It is intended to supplement, not duplicate, the full [OWL Independent Contractor Payment Terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z2ywwHfvvBT5bkURp7z4MDFCGkNLkb3Poetp0Q9_1FE/edit?usp=sharing) document, which should be referenced for details regarding pay rates, invoicing, and tier advancement.

## **Overview**

Open Way Learning (OWL) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit committed to advancing learner-centered innovation in education. OWL contracts with highly qualified individuals ("OWL Fellows") to provide services such as professional development, workshops, and coaching to clients across the U.S.

## **OWL Fellows & Contractor Status**

**OWL Fellows:**

* Are independent contractors, not OWL employees  
* Work under the terms of a signed Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA).  
* Are not guaranteed work, but may be invited to support OWL services based on alignment, availability, and client need.  
* Are responsible for all tax reporting, business registration, and insurance as outlined in the ICA.

**OWL will not:**

* Set an OWL Fellow’s regular hours beyond the scope of a contract.  
* Provide ongoing training, internal equipment, or employee benefits beyond initial onboarding resources.  
* Prohibit Fellows from working with other clients, organizations, or entities outside of OWL.

|  ⚠️ Important Note on Contractor Boundaries ⚠️  In order to maintain compliance with IRS and labor regulations, OWL is committed to preserving the legal distinction between contractors and employees. For this reason, OWL Fellows: Will not receive OWL email addresses Will not be added to internal communication platforms (e.g., Slack) Will not have access to project management systems (e.g., Productive) for internal team collaboration or task management However, OWL may, at its discretion, provide limited access to certain systems (such as Productive) strictly for administrative convenience—for example, to view scheduled service dates or submit invoices. This access is optional, not required, and will not be used to assign or manage tasks. Contractors may use their own tools for scheduling and billing as they see fit. All planning and communication with OWL contractors will occur through designated OWL staff, email, or shared project documents related to an approved Scope of Work. These boundaries are essential to uphold both the legal framework of the contractor relationship and the operational integrity of OWL’s nonprofit structure. |

## **Expectations for OWL Fellows**

Fellows are expected to:

* Act in accordance with OWL’s mission, vision, values, and Code of Ethics.  
* Deliver high-quality, learner-centered facilitation aligned with adult learning best practices.  
* Maintain professionalism in communication and conduct.  
* Complete deliverables and reports in a timely manner.  
* Comply with the OWL Travel Policy for reimbursable expenses.

Fellows are encouraged to:

* Use the OWL Competencies framework to guide personal growth.  
* Engage in continuous improvement through reflection and feedback.  
* Share tools and practices in alignment with OWL’s open-source philosophy.

## **Scope of Work & Service Assignments**

All services performed by OWL Fellows must be detailed in an approved Contractor Scope of Work (SOW), which includes:

* Description of the services to be performed  
* Locations and delivery format (onsite or virtual)  
* Applicable OWL and client contacts  
* Timeframe for the work  
* Reference to compensation, rates, and responsibilities aligned with the ICA

The SOW becomes an extension of the contractor’s Independent Contractor Agreement and must be accepted in writing (typically via email) within 72 hours of being issued. OWL Fellows are assigned to scopes based on client requests, skill fit, availability, geographic proximity, and any preferences expressed by the Fellow.

All services must remain within the boundaries of the approved Scope. Any additional responsibilities—such as facilitating strategy calls, planning meetings, or post-session coaching—must receive written approval from the OWL Program Manager.

While OWL Program Managers are responsible for logistics and client communications, Fellows should remain aware of the technical and planning details (e.g., tech checks, Padlets, Zoom links, Google Docs access) and assist as appropriate when aligned with the ICA.

OWL reserves the right to amend or cancel scopes. Fellows may decline any revised SOW.

## **Service Delivery Workflow**

This section outlines the full life cycle of an OWL Fellow's engagement in a contracted service, from onboarding to post-service wrap-up. It ensures clarity around responsibilities and expectations for both the OWL Fellow and OWL Program Manager.

### **1\. Contractor Onboarding**

* The OWL Fellow completes the OWL Orientation process.  
* Signs the Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA), W-9 form, and (if applicable) Direct Deposit Authorization Form.  
* Reviews and acknowledges the OWL Code of Ethics and Technology Requirements.  
* Receives access to key OWL documents and templates, including the Contractor Manual, Payment Terms, and Scope of Work (SOW) template.

  ### **2\. Service Engagement Initiation**

* The OWL Program Manager notifies the Fellow of a potential upcoming service and shares:  
  * A high-level overview of the engagement.  
  * A copy of the Client Contract or MOU for background and context.  
* The OWL Fellow confirms their interest and availability for the service.  
* The OWL Program Manager prepares and sends an official Contractor Scope of Work (SOW) detailing:  
  * Deliverables  
  * Service location and format  
  * Dates  
  * Compensation and travel terms  
* The Fellow reviews and signs the SOW, acknowledging the terms and confirming their participation (typically via email reply within 72 hours).  
* Note that while service dates are proposed in the Contractor Scope of Work, unless noted otherwise, these dates are considered flexible and may be adjusted with mutual agreement. New dates or revisions must be confirmed in writing via email and do not require a formal amendment unless the nature or scope of services materially changes.

  ### **3\. Service Planning & Preparation**

* The OWL Fellow collaborates with the OWL Program Manager and client through:  
  * A virtual intake call (hosted by the Program Manager).  
  * One or more planning meetings or 5P protocol sessions, if applicable.  
* The OWL Program Manager ensures that all logistics are confirmed, including:  
  * Client location and point of contact  
  * Travel arrangements (if applicable)  
  * Workshop materials and client-facing technology readiness (Zoom, Padlet, shared docs, etc.)  
* The OWL Fellow reviews and aligns the planned content to meet the goals of the client and OWL’s values for learner-centered innovation.  
* Workshop materials may be provided by OWL, the client, or the OWL Fellow depending on the engagement. The responsible party for material creation and distribution will be indicated in the Scope of Work or determined during the planning call. Any new materials created by the OWL Fellow using OWL tools or content must align with OWL’s open-source licensing and branding guidelines.

  ### **4\. Service Delivery**

* The OWL Fellow facilitates the service (workshop, PD session, design sprint, coaching, etc.) as outlined in the Scope of Work.  
* The Fellow ensures:  
  * High-quality facilitation  
  * Participant engagement  
  * Clear alignment with OWL's competencies and deliverables  
* The OWL Fellow documents any immediate needs or issues and communicates with the OWL Program Manager if follow-up or real-time support is required.

  ### **5\. Post-Service Follow-Up**

* The OWL Program Manager sends a post-service email to the client, which may include:  
  * A follow-up survey  
  * Anchor documents, links, and session resources  
  * Certificates of completion (if applicable)  
  * Next steps for continued partnership  
* The OWL Fellow submits a brief trip report or reflection, which may include:  
  * Key observations or takeaways  
  * Participant engagement highlights  
  * Suggested next steps or improvements  
* The OWL Program Manager may share confidential client feedback or survey data with the Fellow to support growth. Fellows are encouraged to reflect on this data but must not share it with clients or external parties.

  ### **6\. Invoicing and Payment**

* The OWL Fellow prepares and submits an itemized invoice no later than the 15th of the month following the service.  
  * Invoice should include: dates, service type (e.g., planning, facilitation), and total hours or days worked.  
  * Any travel receipts must be attached and labeled.  
* OWL processes payments by the end of the same month.  
* If the Fellow has completed a Direct Deposit Authorization Form, payment will be sent via ACH. Otherwise, a paper check will be mailed to the address on file.  
* OWL generally allows planning hours to total up to one-third (⅓) of the total contracted service hours, unless otherwise approved in writing. For example, if a service includes 6 days (48 hours) of delivery, up to 16 hours may be approved for planning.   
* Travel days and reimbursable hours are determined per the budget and OWL Travel Policy, and should be pre-approved and reflected in the Scope of Work.

## **Compensation & Advancement**

Compensation is determined per the OWL Consultant Tier system and Independent Contractor Payment Terms. Fellows can increase their compensation by:

* Demonstrating high performance and growth in OWL Competencies  
* Completing multiple services with positive feedback  
* Contributing to OWL tools, strategy, or curriculum

Advancement reviews may occur every 6–12 months based on service history.

## **Referral & Incentive Opportunities**

Fellows may be eligible for referral bonuses when they:

* Introduce a new client who signs a contract within 12 months  
* Submit referrals per OWL’s business development guidelines

Refer to the OWL Independent Contractor Payment Terms for specific bonus amounts and conditions.

## **Prohibited Conduct**

OWL Fellows may be removed from the active contractor pool for:

* Repeated substandard performance  
* Breach of contract or professional ethics  
* Harassment, discrimination, or retaliation  
* Sharing confidential information  
* Failing to comply with client or OWL safety protocols

**Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Clause**

During your tenure as an OWL Fellow and for one year following the conclusion of your last contracted service, you agree not to engage in or solicit work that directly competes with OWL’s core services for any OWL client you served under a Scope of Work. “Similar work” refers to services closely aligned with OWL’s mission and offerings (e.g., learner-centered innovation, design thinking facilitation, PBL coaching). This clause does not prevent you from providing unrelated services to other educational clients or organizations.

**Code of Ethics Acknowledgment**

OWL Fellows are expected to act in alignment with OWL’s mission, vision, and core values when representing OWL during service delivery. As a condition of being assigned to contracted work, OWL Fellows agree to abide by [OWL’s Code of Ethics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1andwhEY4KWl_4leE2MoSfHpXAOc3Nrz4le6gC_NX52M/edit?usp=sharing) while actively performing services under an approved Scope of Work. This expectation does not imply employment, but rather reflects OWL’s commitment to ethical, inclusive, and learner-centered engagement with all clients and communities.

## **Additional Guidelines**

* Fellows should not solicit or perform similar services for OWL clients outside of an OWL contract for 12 months following the last OWL engagement with that client.  
* Fellows must submit any required background checks or insurance verification when requested by OWL or its clients.  
* Fellows are expected to bring their own laptops and supplies unless otherwise agreed upon.

## **Definitions of Key Documents**

To ensure consistency, transparency, and compliance, OWL uses the following key documents in its contractor engagement process:

* ### **Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA):** The ICA is a legal agreement between OWL and the contractor that outlines the terms of the independent contractor relationship. It defines the contractor's status, general responsibilities, compensation structure, tax obligations, confidentiality terms, non-solicitation clauses, and legal protections. The ICA must be signed before any services can be provided.

* ### **Scope of Work (SOW):** The SOW is a project-specific addendum to the ICA that outlines the what, when, where, and how of a particular engagement. It includes details such as the description of services, duration, deliverables, client and OWL points of contact, reimbursement policies, and any specific requirements tied to that project. All work performed by an OWL Fellow must be explicitly listed in an approved SOW.

* ### **Client-Facing Proposal:** This is the initial document OWL provides to potential or current clients. It summarizes the proposed goals, services, timeline, and budget for a prospective engagement. It is not legally binding, but serves as the foundation for future planning and (if accepted) will inform the creation of a Scope of Work and client contract.

* ### **Client Contract:** The formal agreement between OWL and the client organization. It details deliverables, responsibilities, payment terms, timelines, and other terms mutually agreed upon. The client contract is signed by an authorized representative of the client and OWL leadership. It may incorporate or reference the Client-Facing Proposal.

* ### **Invoice:** A billing document submitted by the contractor to OWL for completed services. It should include an itemized list of service hours and categories (e.g., facilitation, planning, travel), aligned with the approved Scope of Work. Invoices must follow OWL’s submission schedule and formatting requirements.
