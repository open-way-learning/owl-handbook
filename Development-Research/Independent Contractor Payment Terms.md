# **OWL INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR PAYMENT TERMS** 

## **Purpose:**

This document outlines OWL’s values-driven approach to determining compensation for independent contractors, especially those serving as OWL Fellows. While not a rigid policy, it offers a flexible framework to support thoughtful, case-by-case decisions that reflect the project’s scope, funding availability, and alignment with OWL’s mission. It is designed to ensure clarity, equity, and alignment with OWL’s values, while remaining adaptable to individual contract terms and the financial realities of each project.

While this is not a rigid policy, it provides an intentional starting point to guide case-by-case compensation decisions through a shared philosophy and transparent rationale.

## **Philosophical Foundation**

OWL’s approach to contractor compensation is grounded in the same principles that shape internal compensation for employees:

* **Equity & Impact**: Rates reflect a contractor’s expertise, lived experience, and contribution to learner-centered innovation—without bias.

* **Transparency**: Clear guidance is available for how to qualify for and progress through contractor tiers.

* **Sustainability**: OWL retains 20–25% of client revenue to sustain core nonprofit operations, knowledge development, and public resources.

* **Mission over Market Rates**: We acknowledge our rates may not match national consulting averages, but we prioritize **mission alignment, flexibility, trust**, and **co-ownership** as additional forms of value.

* **Context-Responsive Design**: Rates are co-developed based on the specific scope, goals, and funding for each project—balancing clarity with adaptability.

*Note: In some cases, client contracts may impose budget ceilings that limit OWL’s ability to offer previously agreed-upon or tier-based rates. In such cases, the contractor is under no obligation to accept the assignment and may choose to decline the engagement or negotiate a mutually acceptable reduced rate with OWL.*

## **Consultant Tiers & Pay Ranges**

OWL determines an individual’s initial tier during onboarding or when assigning a new Scope of Work. Advancement may occur based on documented demonstration of OWL’s core competencies, positive feedback from project delivery, and increased complexity of assigned work. OWL Contractors/Fellows may also request a tier review after completing three OWL projects or 12 months of engagement, whichever comes first.

The following ranges reflect the most common compensation levels used by OWL for direct services (e.g., facilitation, design, coaching), but actual rates are defined in each scope of work based on project specifics.

| Tier | Title | Typical Range | Profile Summary |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | Associate Consultant | $50–$80/hr | New to OWL and works toward co-facilitating established OWL sessions or providing coaching under direction as they develop fluency in OWL frameworks and client-facing practices. |
| **2** | Core Consultant | $60–$110/hr | Strong alignment to OWL approach, consistently positive evaluations, serves as confident OWL facilitator or coach. |
| **3** | Senior Consultant | $100–$125/hr | Advanced competency, often serves as lead designer, evaluator, or advisor for complex projects. Mentors other Fellows, contributes to innovation or tool creation, and consistently earns high ratings in client feedback and internal debriefs. |
| **4** | Strategic/Expert Lead | $10–$150+/hr | High-demand expert; national or system-wide presence or reputation; models full OWL competency spectrum |

***Note:** All rates are subject to final approval based on project scope and funding availability. For shorter engagements or partial-day work, rates may be calculated on a half-day or hourly basis using the above estimates.*

*OWL’s standard daily facilitation rate is calculated based on approximately 6–7 hours of direct service time, typically translating to 7x the hourly rate. For example, a contractor with an approved hourly rate of $75 would receive a daily rate of $525 (i.e. $75 × 7 hours). This daily rate may be adjusted depending on the contractor’s tier, the complexity of the service, and the project’s funding capacity.*

## **Consultant Tier Rubric (Out of 40 Points)**

OWL’s objective scoring system that is used evaluates a contractor’s readiness and advancement:

| Dimension | Criteria | Max Points |
| ----- | ----- | :---: |
| **Education Experience** | K–12 classroom or school experience/system leadership (1 pt/year) | 10 |
| **Adult Learning / PD Experience** | Engaging, interactive PD design, coaching, facilitation (2 pts/year) | 10 |
| **OWL-Specific Experience** | OWL Fellow (5), Ambassador (2), participation in past OWL projects/design sprints/workshops (1–3 each), familiarity with OWL tools, resources, and/or co-design process (up to 5\) | 10 |
| **Competency Proficiency** | Demonstration of proficiency with OWL’s 6 competency domains (coaching, facilitation, pedagogy, philosophy, communication, leadership) | 10 |

**Tier Mapping:**

* 0–15 pts → Tier 1  
* 16–25 pts → Tier 2  
* 26–34 pts → Tier 3  
* 35–40 pts → Tier 4

## **Fellowship Integration**

### **OWL Ambassadors and Fellows**

* **Ambassadors**: Volunteer champions who model OWL’s mission within their own learning communities.  
* **Fellows**: Recognized leaders in the OWL ecosystem who have demonstrated large-scale impact and alignment with OWL’s values.  
* **Fellowship and Compensation**:  
  * Fellows do not automatically receive consulting work, but are prioritized for opportunities based on availability, fit, and funding.  
  * Most Fellows qualify for Tier 3 or Tier 4 pay once actively engaged in OWL service delivery.  
  * Pay is based on actual services rendered, not title alone.

  ### **Contribution-Based Advancement:**

* Fellows who complete 1–2 services/year with positive feedback may maintain Tier 3 status.  
* Fellows who complete 6+ high-quality services/year and demonstrate leadership, adaptability, and tool creation may be considered for advancement to Tier 4\.

## **Client Rate Percentage Model**

OWL’s client-facing rates and contractor pay percentages reflect a need to balance fair compensation with the long-term sustainability of a small nonprofit. This ensures we can reinvest in innovation, open-source tools, and broader field-building efforts that benefit all.

| Service Type | Contractor Pay | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Face-to-Face Facilitation | 80% of client rate or tier minimum | High engagement delivery |
| Virtual Facilitation | 75% of client rate or tier minimum | Online workshops or coaching |
| Planning/Prep | 75% of agreed delivery rate | Half-day minimum applies |
| Curriculum Dev / Internal | $80–$100/hr or as scoped | Final rates for curriculum development, conferences, or other scoped work will be negotiated based on complexity, timeline, and expertise required, and must be documented in the approved Scope of Work. |

*Note that OWL retains 20–25% for operations and IP development. Contractor pay does not equal full client rate.*

## **Travel Reimbursement**

* Pre-approved travel (lodging, meals, mileage, transport) is reimbursed per [OWL’s Travel Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lvw8vxFSF2Qf0LbIIPfAN4ur2GNZEkgTKLCkuOhJ0o/edit?usp=sharing). 

  ## **Referral Incentive**

* OWL offers a one-time incentive to contractors who successfully refer new clients that result in executed contracts with the nonprofit. This program applies to the business development portion of this agreement and is subject to the following terms:  
  * **Eligibility Criteria:** The referral must result in a new, first-time client entering into a signed contract with OWL. Only one incentive may be awarded per referred client, and the referring contractor must have played a direct and documented role in initiating and securing the opportunity. OWL leadership retains the sole authority to determine eligibility.  
  * **Incentive Amounts:**  
    * $500 for referred projects with a total contract value of less than $10,000  
    * $1,000 for referred projects with a total contract value of $10,000 or more  
* **Payout Terms:** Incentive payments will be issued only after OWL has received the first payment from the referred client under the executed contract. The incentive applies only to the initial contract and does not extend to future or recurring work from the same client.

  ## **Invoicing & Payment**

* Invoices are due within **45 days** of service.  
* Use [OWL’s invoice template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_pHcdQ-ISu2A58pzKK-nfo9sPKoFsFU0f1fLwtqmpTs/edit?usp=sharing) with categories (e.g., planning, facilitation, travel) unless you have your own.  
* Invoices should be submitted **by the 15th of each month** whenever possible, to ensure processing and payment by the end of that month, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Scope of Work. OWL’s goal is to ensure payment is processed within **30 days** of approval.

## **Advancement & Feedback**

### **Advancement Criteria:**

* Accumulate positive evaluations from OWL leadership or clients  
* Demonstrate growth in OWL’s **6 Core Competencies**  
* Lead/co-lead engagements  
* Develop or refine OWL resources  
* Regular contributions to webinars, blogs, or storytelling

  ### **Evaluation Process:**

  ## **Appendix 1: OWL Contractor Compensation Benchmarks**

OWL uses a tiered contractor compensation model informed by credible, mission-aligned nonprofit organizations. The following summarizes realistic benchmarks that OWL uses to guide contractor compensation decisions and ensure fairness across service types and tiers.

#### **Primary Benchmark Sources:**

1. **PBLWorks (Buck Institute for Education) – Actual NF Rate (as of 2022\)**  
   * $75/hour – for workshop facilitation, coaching, and planning  
   * Applies to trained National Faculty with advanced facilitation credentials  
   * Note: Advertised “external” rates ($900–$1,200/day) are typically billed to clients, not paid to contractors

2. **Learning Forward – Consultant Rate Benchmarks**  
   * $900–$1,300/day to clients  
   * Estimated contractor pay: $100–$125/hour for high-expertise instructional consultants

3. **Independent Sector – Nonprofit Labor Valuation**  
   * $33.49/hour \= national baseline (not contractor-level compensation)  
   * Contractor pay in education nonprofits should generally be 2–3x this baseline

#### **Benchmark Contractor Rates**

| Service Type | Typical Contractor Rates | Equivalent Hourly Range |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| Full-Day Facilitation (6–8 hrs) | $600–$1,000/day | $75–$125/hour |
| Half-Day Facilitation (3–4 hrs) | $300–$500/half day | $75–$125/hour |
| Planning & Development | $60–$100/hour | — |
| Virtual Coaching | $75–$125/hour | — |

*Disclaimer:  This rate range is intended as a starting point to guide the determination of a fair and equitable initial pay rate for contractors. OWL will always strive to align compensation with experience, service type, and scope complexity. Note however, that certain client contracts may include budget ceilings that limit OWL’s ability to offer previously agreed-upon or tier-based rates. In such cases, the contractor is under no obligation to accept the assignment and may choose to decline the engagement or negotiate a mutually acceptable reduced rate with OWL.*

## **Appendix 2: Example Scenarios \- Tiered Compensation in Practice**

### **Scenario 1: Virtual Workshop – Core Consultant (Tier 2\)**
