# **OWL INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR PAYMENT TERMS** 

## **Purpose:**

This procedure outlines OWL’s guiding approach to ensure fair, transparent, and mission-aligned compensation for consultants, including those invited through the OWL Fellowship program. It is designed to support consistency in how we evaluate and compensate contracted services, especially those helping schools and districts scale learner-centered innovation.

Importantly, this procedure is not a rigid policy. It provides a flexible framework that supports thoughtful, case-by-case decisions based on the nature of the work, the consultant’s qualifications, and the project’s funding context. The goal is to balance clarity with adaptability—ensuring alignment to OWL’s values while allowing for professional discretion and mutual agreement.

## **Core Compensation Principles**

1. **Fairness & Equity:** Pay reflects a consultant’s experience, competency, and contribution—across all identities and backgrounds.

2. **Transparency & Advancement:** Clear guidance for how to earn, maintain, and progress through consultant tiers.

3. **Sustainability:** OWL retains 20–25% of client revenue to support core operations. Consultant rates are derived accordingly and do not match market consulting rates dollar-for-dollar.

4. **Competency-Driven Growth:** Advancement is based not only on years of experience, but also demonstrated mastery of OWL’s core competencies and positive evaluation feedback from consulting engagements.

## **Consultant Tiers & Pay Ranges**

| Tier | Title | Typical Range | Profile Summary |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | Associate Consultant | $40–$60/hr | Emerging practitioner; supports delivery; limited OWL experience |
| **2** | Core Consultant | $60–$90/hr | Delivers content; growing competency; 1–2 prior OWL engagements |
| **3** | Senior Consultant | $90–$125/hr | Leads engagements; OWL Fellow or repeat contractor; strong competencies |
| **4** | Strategic/Expert Lead | $125–$140+/hr | High-demand expert; national presence; models full OWL competency spectrum |

*Note that all rates are subject to final approval based on project scope and funding availability.*

## **Consultant Tier Rubric (Out of 40 Points)**

This scoring system evaluates readiness and advancement based on:

| Dimension | Criteria | Max Points |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Education Experience** | K–12/classroom/system leadership (1 pt/year) | 10 |
| **Adult Learning / PD Experience** | PD design, coaching, facilitation (2 pts/year) | 10 |
| **OWL-Specific Experience** | OWL Fellow (5), Ambassador (2), past projects (1–3 each), tool or curriculum co-design (up to 5\) | 10 |
| **Competency Proficiency** | Based on OWL’s 6 domains (coaching, facilitation, pedagogy, philosophy, communication, leadership) | 10 |

**Tier Mapping:**

* 0–15 pts → Tier 1  
* 16–25 pts → Tier 2  
* 26–34 pts → Tier 3  
* 35–40 pts → Tier 4

  ## **Fellowship Integration**

* **Ambassadors**: Volunteer champions who model OWL’s mission within their own learning communities.  
* **Fellows**: Recognized leaders in the OWL ecosystem who have demonstrated large-scale impact and alignment with OWL’s values.  
* **Fellowship and Compensation**:  
  * Fellows do not automatically receive consulting work, but are prioritized for opportunities based on availability, fit, and funding.  
  * Most Fellows qualify for Tier 3 or Tier 4 pay once actively engaged in OWL service delivery.  
  * Pay is based on actual services rendered, not title alone.

  ### **Contribution-Based Advancement:**

* Fellows who complete 1–2 services/year with positive feedback may maintain Tier 3 status.  
* Fellows who complete 6+ high-quality services/year and demonstrate leadership, adaptability, and tool creation may be considered for advancement to **Tier 4**.


## **Client Rate Percentage Model**

| Service Type | Contractor Pay | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Face-to-Face Facilitation | 80% of client rate or tier minimum | High engagement delivery |
| Virtual Facilitation | 75% of client rate or tier minimum | Online workshops or coaching |
| Planning/Prep | 75% of agreed delivery rate | Half-day minimum applies |
| Curriculum Dev / Internal | $80–$100/hr or as scoped | Final rates for curriculum development, conferences, or other scoped work will be negotiated based on complexity, timeline, and expertise required, and must be documented in the approved Scope of Work. |

*Note that OWL retains 20–25% for operations and IP development. Contractor pay does not equal full client rate.*

## **Travel Reimbursement**

* Pre-approved travel (lodging, meals, mileage, transport) is reimbursed per [OWL’s Travel Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lvw8vxFSF2Qf0LbIIPfAN4ur2GNZEkgTKLCkuOhJ0o/edit?usp=sharing). 

  ## **Referral Incentive**

* OWL offers a one-time incentive to contractors who successfully refer new clients that result in executed contracts with the nonprofit. This program applies to the business development portion of this agreement and is subject to the following terms:  
  * **Eligibility Criteria:** The referral must result in a new, first-time client entering into a signed contract with OWL. Only one incentive may be awarded per referred client, and the referring contractor must have played a direct and documented role in initiating and securing the opportunity. OWL leadership retains the sole authority to determine eligibility.  
  * **Incentive Amounts:**  
    * $500 for referred projects with a total contract value of less than $10,000  
    * $1,000 for referred projects with a total contract value of $10,000 or more  
* **Payout Terms:** Incentive payments will be issued only after OWL has received the first payment from the referred client under the executed contract. The incentive applies only to the initial contract and does not extend to future or recurring work from the same client.

  ## **Invoicing & Payment**

* Invoices are due within **45 days** of service.  
* Use [OWL’s invoice template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_pHcdQ-ISu2A58pzKK-nfo9sPKoFsFU0f1fLwtqmpTs/edit?usp=sharing) with categories (e.g., planning, facilitation, travel) unless you have your own.  
* Invoices should be submitted **by the 15th of each month** whenever possible, to ensure processing and payment by the end of that month, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Scope of Work. OWL’s goal is to ensure payment is processed within **30 days** of approval.

  ## **Advancement & Feedback**

  ### **Advancement Criteria:**

* Accumulate positive evaluations from OWL leadership or clients  
* Demonstrate growth in OWL’s **6 Core Competencies**  
* Lead/co-lead engagements  
* Develop or refine OWL resources  
* Regular contributions to webinars, blogs, or storytelling

  ### **Evaluation Process:**

* Reviewed after every engagement for quality  
* Annual review for active Fellows and repeat contractors  
* Self-assessment available upon request

  ## **Appendix 1: OWL Contractor Compensation Benchmarks**

OWL uses a tiered contractor compensation model informed by credible, mission-aligned nonprofit organizations. The following summarizes realistic benchmarks that OWL uses to guide contractor compensation decisions and ensure fairness across service types and tiers.

#### **Primary Benchmark Sources:**

1. **PBLWorks (Buck Institute for Education) – Actual NF Rate (as of 2022\)**  
   * $75/hour – for workshop facilitation, coaching, and planning  
   * Applies to trained National Faculty with advanced facilitation credentials  
   * Note: Advertised “external” rates ($900–$1,200/day) are typically billed to clients, not paid to contractors

2. **Learning Forward – Consultant Rate Benchmarks**  
   * $900–$1,300/day to clients  
   * Estimated contractor pay: $100–$125/hour for high-expertise instructional consultants

3. **Independent Sector – Nonprofit Labor Valuation**  
   * $33.49/hour \= national baseline (not contractor-level compensation)  
   * Contractor pay in education nonprofits should generally be 2–3x this baseline

#### **Benchmark Contractor Rates**

| Service Type | Typical Contractor Rates | Equivalent Hourly Range |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| Full-Day Facilitation (6–8 hrs) | $600–$1,000/day | $75–$125/hour |
| Half-Day Facilitation (3–4 hrs) | $300–$500/half day | $75–$125/hour |
| Planning & Development | $60–$100/hour | — |
| Virtual Coaching | $75–$125/hour | — |

*Disclaimer:  This rate range is intended as a starting point to guide the determination of a fair and equitable initial pay rate for contractors. OWL will always strive to align compensation with experience, service type, and scope complexity. Note however, that certain client contracts may include budget ceilings that limit OWL’s ability to offer previously agreed-upon or tier-based rates. In such cases, the contractor is under no obligation to accept the assignment and may choose to decline the engagement or negotiate a mutually acceptable reduced rate with OWL.*
