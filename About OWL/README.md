# About OWL

This section introduces the foundational philosophy and values behind Open Way Learning (OWL).

Whether you're a new team member, a partner school, or someone exploring our work, these pages provide context about:

- **Our Why** — the mission, vision, and core beliefs that drive us
- **Our Culture** — the values and organizational practices we embody
- **Our Approach** — how we bring our work to life through partnerships with schools and communities

Each entry is a living document and reflects OWL’s commitment to transparency, co-design, and continuous improvement.
