# Administration & HR

**Owner:** Director of Finance & Operations (DFO) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff

---

This section includes key policies and practices related to OWL’s internal operations, with a focus on supporting team members through clear expectations, transparent communication, and equitable systems.

It is actively maintained by the **DFO**, who ensures that the documents in this section are up to date, accessible, and aligned with OWL’s values and legal responsibilities. Any proposed changes to these documents should be coordinated with the Manager for alignment, accuracy, and final approval.

While this folder may intersect with files in the `Operations-Finance/` and `Governance/` sections, the materials here specifically support OWL’s people systems—centered on culture, accountability, and staff wellbeing.

### Core Responsibilities Tied to This Folder Include:
- Managing and maintaining OWL’s **employee handbook**, benefits documentation, and compliance with employment law  
- Coordinating **hiring, onboarding, and offboarding** processes for staff   
- Supporting the development and communication of **compensation, leave, and evaluation** systems  
- Administering employee **benefits**, tracking performance cycles, and ensuring role clarity  
- Maintaining all contractor documentation and supporting OWL Fellows in coordination with the Director of Development & Research  
- Documenting and archiving key organizational processes, policies, and decisions  
- Supporting a healthy, inclusive work environment through clear communication and DEI-informed practices

Refer to OWL’s [Organizational Chart](../Governance/org-chart.pdf) for current role assignments or contact any OWL Director for clarification.
