# Administration & HR

{% hint style="info" %}
**Owner:** Director of Finance & Operations (DFO) – with input from all Directors  
**Audience:** All OWL staff
{% endhint %}

## Purpose

This section includes key policies and practices related to OWL's internal operations, with a focus on supporting team members through clear expectations, transparent communication, and equitable systems.

It is actively maintained by the **DFO**, who ensures that the documents in this section are up to date, accessible, and aligned with OWL’s values and legal responsibilities. Any proposed changes to these documents should be coordinated with the Manager for alignment, accuracy, and final approval.

While this folder may intersect with files in the `Operations-Finance/` and `Governance/` sections, the materials here specifically support OWL’s people, administration, and HR systems - all centered on culture, accountability, and staff wellbeing.

### Core Responsibilities Tied to This Section

- Managing and maintaining OWL’s **employee handbook**, benefits documentation, and compliance with employment law
- Documenting all organizational policies, procedures, and protocols  
- Coordinating hiring, onboarding, and offboarding processes for staff   
- Supporting the development and communication of compensation, vacation, and evaluation systems  
- Administering employee benefits, tracking performance cycles, and ensuring role clarity  
- Supporting a healthy, inclusive work environment through clear communication and DEI-informed practices
