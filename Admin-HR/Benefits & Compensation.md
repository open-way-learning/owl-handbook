### **PURPOSE:** 

This document provides an overview of OWL’s benefits, stipends, salary policies, and our compensation philosophy.

### **BENEFITS AND INSURANCE** 

Open Way Learning offers a range of benefits to support the personal well-being and long-term financial security of our team. Our benefits reflect OWL’s commitment to supporting our employees in a sustainable, equitable, and transparent way.

#### **Retirement Plan \- 403(b)**

All full-time employees are eligible to participate in OWL’s 403(b) retirement plan, administered by Newport Group, with investment options through Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds.

* OWL provides a non-elective employer contribution of 5% of the employee’s base salary, deposited each pay period—regardless of whether the employee contributes.  
* Employees may elect to make additional voluntary contributions (pre-tax and/or Roth) up to the IRS annual contribution limits (e.g., \~$20,500 in 2022; updated annually).  
* Enrollment support and plan details are provided upon hiring and are available upon request.

*Why this matters:* This benefit supports your long-term financial well-being and grows automatically over time, even if you choose not to make additional contributions.

#### **Health Insurance Stipend**

Until OWL reaches the scale to support a group health plan, all full-time employees receive a monthly $500 health insurance stipend to help offset the cost of individual coverage.

* Employees are encouraged to use this stipend to purchase insurance through [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov) or a private provider.  
* The stipend may be:  
  * Included in your paycheck as taxable income, or  
  * Redirected as a contribution to your 403(b) plan  
* To select your preference, contact the OWL Administrative Associate. If no preference is submitted, the default will be paycheck inclusion.

*Note:* This is a reimbursement-style stipend, not a formal group health plan, but it is designed to offer flexibility while keeping costs manageable for both employees and OWL.

#### **Other Benefits**

* Government-Mandated Programs: OWL complies with all legal benefit programs, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Employee contributions are withheld from each paycheck, and OWL contributes the required employer match.  
* OWL offers full-time employees an $80/month technology stipend to help offset mobile phone and internet expenses necessary for remote work, collaboration, and virtual facilitation. Note that OWL may alternatively cover the cost of these services directly via a company credit card if the account is registered in the organization's name and used exclusively for OWL business.  
* OWL provides a one-time moving stipend of up to $1,000 for new full-time employees or for existing employees who are relocating in a way that provides strategic benefit to OWL’s regional presence or client services. This stipend may help cover the cost of transportation, shipping, or temporary housing during the transition. While OWL is a remote-first organization, proximity to key partner regions, school districts, or conference hubs may enhance program delivery, outreach, and visibility, making relocation support an appropriate and mission-aligned investment. Approval is granted on a case-by-case basis by the OWL Leadership Team.  
* Workers’ Compensation Insurance: All employees (except directors) are covered under OWL’s workers’ compensation policy for work-related injuries or illnesses.  
* Prompt reporting is required for any incident, no matter how minor. Notify a Director immediately in such cases.  
* OWL will provide instructions for submitting a claim and, if needed, refer you to an approved medical provider.  
* Note that failure to report promptly may result in denial of benefits.  
* Claims are administered by an external insurance carrier, whose representatives may contact employees directly during the claims process.

### **OWL COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR EMPLOYEES**

OWL strives to provide a fair, mission-aligned, and sustainable total compensation opportunity for all employees. Our approach reflects industry standards within the education nonprofit sector and supports our ability to attract and retain individuals whose expertise and values advance OWL’s vision for learner-centered innovation. As such, OWL’s compensation program is designed to:

* Reinforce OWL’s core values by making OWL a great place to work—balancing purpose, autonomy, and mastery with strong support for work/life balance.  
* Balance long-term sustainability with available financial resources, ensuring decisions uphold our commitment to fiscal responsibility and equity.  
* Provide a competitive and transparent compensation and benefits package, including:  
  * Fair, reasonable, and equitable base pay for all full-time exempt employees.  
  * A starting hourly wage for part-time and non-exempt employees that exceeds the federal minimum wage and is periodically reviewed for cost-of-living alignment.  
  * Surplus-based bonuses for full-time employees when OWL exceeds budgeted revenue targets (not guaranteed annually; see Appendix B of the [OWL Code of Ethics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1andwhEY4KWl_4leE2MoSfHpXAOc3Nrz4le6gC_NX52M/edit?usp=drive_link)).  
  * Flexible Paid Time Off (PTO) for exempt staff and generous PTO policies for all full- and part-time employees (see Time Off section above).  
  * A robust benefits package, including technology stipends and health-related offerings, as described in the Benefits section.

OWL is also committed to full compliance with all state and federal compensation laws and IRS guidelines for nonprofit organizations. All compensation decisions must support OWL’s tax-exempt mission and be documented as reasonable under IRS definitions, including for senior leadership and directors.

#### **Compensation Benchmarking and Equity Guidelines**

OWL benchmarks compensation against comparable education nonprofits and publicly available data sources (such as 990 reports and sector surveys). To further ensure equity and alignment with our educator-centered mission, OWL uses the national average U.S. teacher salary (adjusted to 12 months) as a reference point for full-time exempt roles. Our benchmark range is as follows:

* The starting salary for any full-time role should be no less than 65% of the national average teacher salary.  
* A goal is set for employees to reach 100% of that benchmark within three years of service.  
* The maximum salary for any OWL employee should generally not exceed 150% of the national average teacher salary.

While this benchmark range is not a hard limit, it serves as a reference to promote fairness, reduce salary compression, and avoid disproportionate pay differences \- especially between leadership and other team members. Increases for employees below benchmark will be prioritized in annual compensation planning, separate from surplus-based, point-system merit adjustments.

#### **Governance and Oversight**

Hourly compensation for part-time and non-exempt employees is determined by the OWL Leadership Team and reviewed by the Board.

Full-time exempt compensation (including for OWL Directors) is reviewed and approved annually by the Board of Directors in alignment with this policy and the procedures outlined in the OWL Salary Adjustment & Bonus SOP.

The Board may establish a Compensation Subcommittee to conduct periodic reviews of market alignment and ensure compliance with OWL’s mission, IRS standards, and evolving organizational capacity.

### **SALARY ADMINISTRATION**

#### **Pay Schedule & Distribution**

* Employees are paid once per month, with payroll issued after 8:00 a.m. ET on the last banking day of the month.  
* Non-exempt employee pay is based on approved timesheets submitted by the 15th of each month for the preceding pay period.  
* Pay includes all earned wages or salary, less required and authorized deductions.  
* Payment is made via direct deposit to the account specified on the employee’s Direct Deposit Authorization Form. If no form is on file, a paper check will be mailed to the employee’s address of record.

OWL strongly encourages all employees to enroll in direct deposit to ensure timely, secure delivery of pay.

#### **Temporary Twice-Monthly Pay Option**

While OWL’s default pay schedule is monthly, employees facing temporary personal financial hardship may request to be paid on a twice-monthly basis for a limited duration.

* Approval is granted on a case-by-case basis by the OWL Leadership Team.  
* Requests must be submitted at least 30 days in advance of the intended start and include the desired duration and reason.  
* Due to increased administrative complexity, this option is only available as a short-term accommodation and may be limited based on staffing and payroll processing capacity.  
* Non-exempt employees must still follow timesheet submission deadlines, and any changes to pay frequency must comply with federal and state labor regulations.

#### **Deductions & Withholdings**

Each paycheck reflects:

* Mandatory deductions: Federal, state, and local income taxes, Social Security (FICA), Medicare, and other legally required withholdings.  
* Elected deductions: Voluntary deductions authorized by the employee, including 403(b) contributions, insurance premiums, or other approved benefit elections.

To set up or change elected deductions, employees should contact the Manager of Finance, HR, and Communications.

### 

#### **Paycheck Errors & Lost Payments**

Employees should promptly notify the Manager of Finance, HR, and Communications if:

* A paycheck appears inaccurate;  
* A payment is missed or not received;  
* A direct deposit or check is sent to an incorrect address or account.

If a paper check is lost or destroyed, OWL reserves the right to charge a replacement processing fee. Also note that payroll advances are not permitted.

### 

#### **Workweek Definition for Non-Exempt Employees**

For timekeeping and overtime purposes, the OWL workweek begins at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and ends at 12:00 midnight the following Saturday. Time worked during this period is used to calculate standard and overtime pay for non-exempt employees.

### 

#### **Personnel File Updates**

Each employee has a confidential personnel file maintained by the Manager of Finance, HR, and Communications. Employees may review their file upon request.  
To ensure timely and accurate pay, all employees must promptly report changes in:

* Name or legal status  
* Address or phone number  
* Banking details  
* Tax withholding elections (e.g., number of exemptions)

#### **Wage Compliance**

OWL assigns positions, determines compensation, and administers overtime in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state and local labor laws. For related expectations on pay equity, transparency, and ethical conduct, refer to the [OWL Code of Conduct & Ethics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1andwhEY4KWl_4leE2MoSfHpXAOc3Nrz4le6gC_NX52M/edit?usp=sharing).
