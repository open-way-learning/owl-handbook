# Communication And Conflict

## OPEN COMMUNICATION & SHARING

At OWL, communication isn’t just encouraged, it’s a core part of how we work. We believe in radical candor, transparency, and mutual respect across all roles and teams. Whether you're raising a question, sharing a concern, or offering a new idea, your voice matters.

If something isn’t clear or simply doesn’t feel right, don’t wait. We expect issues to be surfaced early and addressed directly, with curiosity and a shared commitment to continuous improvement.

Start by speaking with the person closest to the situation. Often, that’s a Director, project lead, or colleague.

If you need additional support, or feel the issue would be better discussed elsewhere, you are encouraged to reach out to anyone on the OWL Leadership Team without fear of reproach.

If an issue involves a sensitive or serious matter, or if internal resolution feels insufficient, you may also contact a member of the Board of Directors, who will engage with care and discretion.

We do not operate in silos. We solve problems together. And we all share responsibility for ensuring that OWL remains a healthy, inclusive, and mission-aligned place to work.

## MANAGING CONFLICTS WITH CURIOSITY & CARE

At OWL, we know that conflict is not a sign of dysfunction, but a natural outcome of passionate people working together toward common goals. When managed well, conflict can be a powerful driver of trust, clarity, innovation, and growth. Avoiding it, however, tends to do the opposite and can lead to dysfunction.

Conflict arises when there are real or perceived differences in values, needs, expectations, or interpretations. These may stem from personality clashes, role ambiguity, resource tensions, communication breakdowns, or simply a tough day.

Rather than defaulting to avoidance, we encourage all OWL team members to approach conflict with curiosity, directness, and empathy; in a way that strengthens rather than erodes trust.

Steps to Address Conflict at OWL

Start with direct, respectful conversation. When possible, go to the person involved first. Clarify your intent. Be open to what you might not understand. Stay focused on the issue, not the individual.

Seek shared understanding and solution-finding. The goal isn’t to “win,” but to surface perspectives and find a path forward that honors both our people and our mission.

Involve a third party if needed. If resolution doesn’t come easily—or if the conversation requires facilitation—reach out to your Director or a trusted colleague to help mediate. Facilitation is not a failure; it’s a way to ensure clarity, fairness, and emotional safety.

Focus on shared data and outcomes. Where relevant, support your perspective with evidence, timelines, or alignment to project outcomes. This helps move conversations from emotional impasse to productive dialogue.

OWL’s Conflict Management Continuum

Different approaches work in different contexts. The following five strategies offer a shared language for navigating conflict at OWL. When in doubt, we encourage aiming for collaboration, but recognize that other approaches have value in specific situations:

Final Thought: Conflict as Co-Design

Remember that conflict isn’t something to “get through,” it’s something to lean into. When approached thoughtfully, even the toughest moments can leave us stronger, clearer, and more connected.

## PERSONNEL RECORDS

OWL takes the responsibility of safeguarding personal information very seriously. We honor the trust employees place in us by handling employee and contractor information with discretion, care, and professionalism.

All personnel records, including job applications, offer letters, position descriptions, salary changes, performance reflections, and documentation of formal concerns, etc. are stored securely and only accessible to those with a legitimate business or legal reason. These records are maintained by the Manager of Finance, HR, and Communications or an approved designee.

What Confidentiality Means at OWL

Medical, personnel, and other sensitive records are kept secure and private.

Access to another person’s records is only allowed when:

It is required by law or contract;

It is part of a documented HR or compliance process;

It has been approved by the OWL Leadership Team.

Employees and contractors may request access to their own personnel file at any time.

While we protect personal information, we also remind team members that use of personal devices for OWL business does not guarantee privacy. Communication related to OWL’s work, regardless of the device used, is considered part of the workplace.

Keeping Your Info Up to Date

Employees are responsible for keeping their personnel information accurate. Please promptly notify your Director or the Manager of Finance, HR, and Communications of any changes to:

Address or phone number

Emergency contact information

Dependents or family status (if relevant to benefits)

Legal name or identification details

We treat this not as a bureaucratic formality, but as part of a culture of mutual respect, operational clarity, and care for one another as people…and professionals.
