# Stipends and Supplemental Benefits

## Purpose

This document describes non-traditional compensation benefits available to OWL team members, including monthly and long-term technology stipends. These benefits help support a high-functioning remote workforce and equitable access to essential tools and connectivity.



## Technology Stipend for Full-Time Employees


To support OWL’s remote and flexible work environment, full-time employees receive a monthly technology stipend of $80 to offset the cost of mobile phone and home internet use for OWL-related work. The $80/month stipend is:

Automatically included in payroll;

Treated as taxable income;

Meant to cover phone, data, or broadband access used for communication, virtual facilitation, and digital collaboration;

No receipts are required, and employees may use the stipend at their discretion.

If desired, OWL may instead cover internet or mobile costs directly using the company card, but only if:

The account is in OWL’s name;

The service is used exclusively for OWL-related business;

Pre-approval is received from the Director of Operations & Finance.

Part-time employees are not eligible for the monthly technology stipend.


## Technology Stipend & Replacement Policy


To ensure long-term device reliability, OWL provides a $1,000 technology stipend to each full-time employee to procure a new laptop once every 36 months (3 years), starting from the date of hire or last issued device/stipend.

The purchased device becomes property of the employee and must meet OWL’s minimum technical specifications.

Employees who leave OWL within 12 months of receiving the stipend may be required to reimburse a prorated amount.

Employees may choose to continue using OWL-issued equipment instead of claiming the stipend, provided the hardware meets ongoing performance standards.

Requests to claim the stipend must be submitted to the Manager of Finance, HR, & Communications.

Device Use & Maintenance Responsibilities

Employees are expected to:

Use OWL-issued laptops exclusively for work-related purposes. Devices should not be shared with family or friends.

Restart laptops at least once per week to support system performance and updates.

Keep OWL files in the Google Drive environment, not stored locally unless temporarily necessary.

Keep hardware clean and in good condition using non-abrasive cleaners.

Promptly report any technical issues or damage to the Director of Operations & Finance.

Understand that any damage caused by misuse or negligence may result in personal financial responsibility for repair or replacement.

Exceptions to these policies must be approved in writing.
