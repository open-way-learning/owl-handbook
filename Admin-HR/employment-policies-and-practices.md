# Employment Policies & Practices
This document outlines OWL's foundational employment policies and expectations, including Equal Opportunity, anti-harassment practices, accommodations, and onboarding protocols. These practices reflect OWL's commitment to a respectful, inclusive, and legally compliant workplace culture. Together, they help ensure that all employees are supported, protected, and positioned to thrive. For related policies, refer to the OWL Code of Conduct & Ethics.

## Equal employment opportunity
Open Way Learning follows the spirit and intent of all federal, state and local employment law and is committed to equal employment opportunity. To that end, the Board of Directors and all officers of Open Way Learning will not discriminate against any employee or applicant in a manner that violates the law. Open Way Learning is committed to providing equal opportunity for all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, personal appearance, family responsibilities, matriculation or any other characteristic protected under federal, state or local law.  Refer to the OWL Code of Conduct & Ethics for additional information.

## Policy against workplace harassment
Open Way Learning is committed to providing a work environment for all employees that is free from sexual harassment and other types of discriminatory harassment. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to show respect for their co‐workers.Refer to the OWL Code of Conduct & Ethics for additional information.

## Religious accommodations
OWL will endeavor to reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs of our employees to the extent such accommodation does not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. If an employee believes they need accommodation to perform the job duties because of a religious belief, the employee should submit a written request to the OWL Leadership Team.

## Solicitation
OWL's culture encourages openness, community engagement, and connection—but we also recognize the need to protect our shared workspace from interruptions or distractions that may interfere with our collective focus.

To that end, this policy outlines expectations around solicitation and distribution of materials in the workplace.

### What's not allowed during work time

* Employees may not solicit donations, memberships, pledges, or promote causes unrelated to OWL's mission during work time—whether for personal, political, commercial, or charitable purposes.  
* Similarly, employees may not distribute non-work-related materials or literature during work time unless explicitly approved in writing by the OWL Leadership Team.  
* “Work time” includes time spent actively performing job duties, but does not include lunch periods, scheduled breaks, or before/after work hours.  
* This policy applies equally to in-person, digital, or hybrid contexts—whether via email, Slack, or other OWL-managed channels.

### What is encouraged—with context
OWL celebrates employees who are civically and socially engaged outside of work, and welcomes occasional sharing of non-partisan opportunities, community events, or relevant educational resources—particularly when aligned to OWL's values.

We simply ask that this be done thoughtfully, transparently, and never in a way that pressures others or disrupts team workflows.

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate to share, please check with the OWL Leadership Team. They are always open to finding the right balance.
