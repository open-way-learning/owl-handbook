### **PURPOSE**

This document covers OWL’s expectations around technology tools, software access, AI use, open licensing, and professional handling of media. It reinforces OWL’s open-source values and commitment to digital ethics, transparency, and responsible innovation.

### **INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**

Open Way Learning (OWL) provides the essential hardware, software, and cloud-based tools necessary for employees to perform their roles effectively in a distributed, remote-first environment. This policy outlines expectations for equipment usage, data management, and eligibility for technology-related support.

#### **Technology for Full-Time Employees**

All full-time employees will be provided with the following standard equipment:

* Laptop (Mac or PC, based on role and inventory)  
* External monitor  
* Keyboard and mouse  
* Necessary cables, adapters, and accessories

This equipment is the property of OWL and must be returned upon separation from the organization unless otherwise approved.

#### **File Storage & Content Management**

To ensure data security, knowledge continuity, and organizational alignment:

* All OWL-related content (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, media, planning files, etc.) must be created and stored within the OWL Google Workspace environment (i.e. using your @openwaylearning.org account).  
* Employees may not store or manage OWL-related content in personal Gmail accounts or external cloud storage systems.  
* Files should be organized clearly and kept up to date in shared team folders or designated drive locations to ensure accessibility by others as needed.

#### **Hardware Ownership, Return, & Purchase Option**

* All OWL-issued equipment is OWL’s property. Employees must return hardware in good condition upon exiting the organization.  
* Departing employees may request to purchase their issued device, pending approval on a case-by-case basis. Purchase price will reflect a prorated fair market value, and the request must be approved by the Director of Operations & Finance.  
* All stickers or customizations must be school-appropriate and removed prior to return (including residue cleanup).

#### **Software Access for Full-Time Employees**

Full-time employees will receive access to the following tools and platforms:

* Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.)  
* Productive (for task planning, time tracking, and project budgeting)  
* Slack (for team messaging and internal communications)  
* Zoom (video meetings, phone calls, and webinars)  
* Mural (for collaborative design sprints and visual facilitation)  
* Calendly or OnceHub (for scheduling external and internal meetings)

Additional software may be provisioned based on the employee’s role or project needs.

#### **Technology Expectations for Part-Time Employees**

Part-time employees are expected to use their personal devices and maintain the following minimum standards:

* Operating System: macOS 10.15+ or Windows 10+  
* Web Browser: Chrome (preferred), Firefox, Safari, or Edge  
* Internet Speed: Minimum 5 Mbps upload/download  
* Webcam: Required for meetings and external service delivery

Due to the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) nature of part-time roles, OWL does not provide IT hardware support for personally owned devices. However, part-time employees will be granted access to OWL software tools based on their roles and responsibilities.

### **DEVICE USE & MAINTENANCE**

Employees are expected to:

* Use OWL-issued laptops exclusively for work-related purposes. Devices should not be shared with family or friends.  
* Restart laptops at least once per week to support system performance and updates.  
* Keep OWL files in the Google Drive environment, not stored locally unless temporarily necessary.  
* Keep hardware clean and in good condition using non-abrasive cleaners.  
* Promptly report any technical issues or damage to the Director of Outreach & Programming.   
* Understand that any damage caused by misuse or negligence may result in personal financial responsibility for repair or replacement.

### Exceptions to these policies must be approved in writing.

### **OPEN SOURCE LICENSING OF MATERIALS**

OWL believes that knowledge grows stronger when it’s shared. That’s why, whenever possible, we release the materials we create, especially those developed for client use, under licenses, aligning with our values of transparency, collaboration, and collective impact.

Most of OWL’s public-facing resources (e.g. slide decks, protocols, frameworks, tools, and guides) are made available for reuse and adaptation under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license or a similar open license, unless otherwise restricted by client contract or grant agreement.

#### **What This Means for You**

Before sharing OWL-created resources externally (outside of a client or internal team), check to ensure the materials:

* Are covered under an OWL Creative Commons license (preferred is BY-NC-SA 4.0); or  
* Are not subject to client or funder confidentiality or usage restrictions.  
* If you plan to reference or adapt materials from another source, especially proprietary content, ensure that:  
* The material is openly licensed; or  
* You have documented permission to use or adapt it; or  
* You cite and link to the original source per fair use guidelines.

#### **Honor Intellectual Property \- Ours and Others’**

We take intellectual property seriously, not as a way to control ideas, but to honor the labor and creativity of others. This means:

* Always giving proper credit;  
* Never claiming others’ work as our own;  
* Asking questions when unsure.

If you’re ever uncertain about how or whether a resource can be shared, check in with a Director before making it public. We’d rather slow down to get it right than misstep in how we represent our work or that of others.

For more information on licensing protocols and usage rights, refer to the .

### **MEDIA CONTACTS**

Any request for information or interviews by the media should be referred to the OWL Director of Programming & Impact Visibility (DPIV).

### **POLICY FOR GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**

Generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, DALL·E, etc.) have quickly become part of the modern knowledge economy, and the education landscape is no exception. At OWL, we recognize both the creative potential and the ethical considerations of using these tools in our work.

As an open, forward-thinking organization, OWL encourages thoughtful and transparent use of AI, especially when it can save time, spark ideas, or improve quality. At the same time, we are deeply committed to ensuring that the final outputs \- whether public-facing or internal \- reflect human-centered insight, cultural relevance, and the distinct voice of OWL.

#### **Guidelines for Responsible AI Use**

You are free to use generative AI tools to assist in the drafting, research, or design of materials for internal planning, professional learning, or organizational development. However, any final product, especially those shared with external audiences (e.g., clients, funders, partners), must:

* Be meaningfully reviewed, edited, and customized;  
* Accurately reflect OWL’s values, voice, and cultural tone;  
* Be free from bias, inaccuracies, or copyright risks associated with unedited AI-generated content.  
* AI should augment your creativity, not replace your critical thinking or professional judgment.

#### **Attribution & Transparency**

If AI was used to substantially shape or generate any part of a public-facing or published work, please include a brief attribution (e.g. “This content was co-developed with support from generative AI tools and refined by OWL team members”).

If you're unsure whether attribution is warranted, seek input from a colleague or Director before finalizing the work. When in doubt, lean toward transparency.

#### **What’s Not Allowed**

* Never submit unedited, AI-generated content as a final product.  
* Do not use generative AI to create outputs on sensitive topics or client materials without human review and adaptation.  
* Do not present AI-generated writing or images as original OWL work without meaningful transformation or attribution.

#### **A Living AI Policy**

This policy will evolve as the technology evolves. We are committed to responsible innovation and will continue to update our practices based on:

* Emerging industry standards;  
* New research on ethical and equitable AI use;  
* Ongoing conversations with educators and communities.

#### **TECHNOLOGY STIPENDS**

To support OWL’s remote and flexible work environment, full-time employees receive a monthly technology stipend of $80 to offset the cost of mobile phone and home internet use for OWL-related work. The $80/month stipend is:

* Automatically included in payroll;  
* Treated as taxable income;  
* Meant to cover phone, data, or broadband access used for communication, virtual facilitation, and digital collaboration;  
* No receipts are required, and employees may use the stipend at their discretion.

If desired, OWL may instead cover internet or mobile costs directly using the company card, but only if:

* The account is in OWL’s name;  
* The service is used exclusively for OWL-related business;  
* Pre-approval is received from the Director of Operations & Finance.

Part-time employees are not eligible for the monthly technology stipend.

### **TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT POLICY**

To ensure long-term device reliability, OWL provides a $1,000 technology stipend to each full-time employee to procure a new laptop once every 36 months (3 years), starting from the date of hire or last issued device/stipend.

The purchased device becomes property of the employee and must meet OWL’s minimum technical specifications.

Employees who leave OWL within 12 months of receiving the stipend may be required to reimburse a prorated amount.

Employees may choose to continue using OWL-issued equipment instead of claiming the stipend, provided the hardware meets ongoing performance standards.

Requests to claim the stipend must be submitted to the Manager of Finance, HR, & Communications.
