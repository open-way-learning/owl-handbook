# Growth And Pd

## PERFORMANCE REFLECTION & GROWTH

At Open Way Learning, performance development is not a once-a-year event - it's an ongoing, collaborative process rooted in mutual trust, radical candor, and shared responsibility. We believe that frequent, open feedback and honest reflection help us grow as individuals, as teams, and as a mission-driven organization. In keeping with our collective leadership model, every employee is both a contributor and co-creator in building a culture of continuous improvement.

Ongoing Feedback & Check-Ins

OWL encourages routine check-ins and informal feedback between all team members, especially between colleagues in manager-direct report relationships. These conversations may include short reflections, coaching moments, or forward-looking goal setting.

Directors are encouraged to hold structured 1:1s at least monthly, with additional team check-ins as appropriate to ensure alignment, reflection, and real-time support.

Feedback is a two-way street: everyone at OWL is empowered - and expected - to give and receive feedback in a spirit of constructive curiosity and shared accountability.

Annual Reflection & Growth Conversation

Each full-time and part-time OWL employee will engage in an annual reflection and growth conversation, coordinated by their Director or a designated peer. This process is not punitive or bureaucratic—it is a guided opportunity to reflect on impact, explore growth edges, and align goals for the coming year. The conversation may include discussion on the following topics (not a comprehensive list):

Key accomplishments and contributions

Alignment with OWL’s mission, values, and strategic priorities

Collaboration, communication, and leadership (formal or informal)

Areas for skill growth, capacity building, or new opportunities

Self-reflection and personal/professional growth

While some structured documentation may be used to guide the process, the conversation itself is meant to be authentic, strengths-based, and empowering.

Multi-Perspective Feedback (Formerly “360”)

We recognize that traditional “360 reviews” have earned a poor reputation when misapplied as punitive or anonymous critique. At OWL, we view multi-perspective feedback as a tool for trust-building and learning, not judgment:

Managers or Directors may invite thoughtful, voluntary input from colleagues, collaborators, or partners who have worked directly with the employee.

All such input must be requested transparently, with the purpose of promoting growth and recognition.

Employees may also proactively invite feedback from peers as part of their own development.

All input gathered should be shared constructively—either directly or through a facilitated discussion—and used to inform growth conversations and personal goal setting.

Requesting a Raise or Promotion

You don’t need to wait to be asked. If you believe your role, contributions, or responsibilities have grown significantly, or you’ve demonstrated value above and beyond expectations, you are encouraged to make your case. Here’s how:

Document your impact: Highlight results, leadership, innovation, or initiative that clearly show your value.

Make it measurable: Where possible, include data, deliverables, or stakeholder feedback.

Be clear: Specify the promotion or raise you’re requesting, and why it aligns with OWL’s goals.

Schedule a formal conversation: Set up a dedicated reflection and growth meeting with the OWL Leadership Team to discuss your request transparently.

Note that raises and promotions are considered in context of organizational needs, financial capacity, and role alignment, and are not guaranteed based on tenure or review ratings alone.

Other Important Notes

Performance reflection applies only to employees (full- and part-time), not to volunteers, vendors, OWL Fellows, or independent contractors.

While performance conversations may inform decisions about raises or advancement, they do not guarantee changes in compensation or title.

Employees who believe a performance review or related personnel decision was inaccurate or unfair may initiate a follow-up conversation with their Director. If needed, concerns may be elevated to the OWL Leadership Team and then, if needed, to the Board of Directors.

A Final Thought on Evaluation & Growth

At OWL, you are the architect of your own professional growth. You don’t need permission to get better, take initiative, or seek new challenges. You are empowered to reflect, request support, and advocate for your role in advancing our collective mission.

## PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Open Way Learning believes that growing our collective impact begins with growing our people. As a team, we are committed to developing not just the skills we need today, but the capacity to adapt, innovate, and lead in the future. We know that investing in individual development strengthens our culture, advances our mission, and builds a healthier, more resilient organization.

Each full-time employee at OWL has access to an equally shared portion of the organization’s annual professional development (PD) budget, which can be used toward any work-related training that enhances both individual skills and OWL’s organizational capacity. This includes:

Registration and enrollment fees

Course or certification costs

Travel and accommodation expenses

Related materials or tools

Employees are encouraged to pursue learning experiences that align with their goals and OWL’s evolving needs, from workshops and courses to in-depth coaching, conferences, or certification programs.

If the OWL Leadership Team collectively determines that more intensive training is needed for one or more specific individuals, which would affect the equal distribution of the PD budget, that decision will be communicated transparently to the full team—along with the rationale and intended benefit to OWL’s shared work.

PD vs. Marketing & Representation

While some conferences or events serve both learning and networking purposes, OWL distinguishes between:

Professional Development, which is funded from the PD budget and intended to build employee skills or knowledge, and

Marketing or Presence-Based Attendance, which is strategic representation at events (e.g., conferences, summits) to build visibility, network, or stay current in the field.

When employees attend conferences primarily to represent OWL, this is typically covered from a separate outreach or marketing budget, not the shared PD fund. Directors will clarify the distinction and funding source when reviewing requests.

Individual Development Planning

Each full-time employee works with their Director to develop an individual professional development plan, which will be revisited during the annual review process. This plan:

Identifies specific areas of interest or growth

Outlines learning opportunities and timelines

Clarifies actions the employee will take to pursue those goals

Helps OWL align team capacity with strategic needs

Employees are responsible for initiating and following through on their plan, with support and feedback from their Director and colleagues. This commitment to professional development reflects our belief in lifelong learning, shared leadership, and the idea that when one of us grows, we all grow.
