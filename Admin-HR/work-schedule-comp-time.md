# Work Schedule Comp Time

## HOURS OF WORK

At OWL, we prioritize flexibility, autonomy, and trust—balanced with the shared responsibility of delivering consistently high-quality work for the schools and partners we serve. To support this balance, we set the following expectations for work hours and availability across employee types.

Full-Time, Exempt Employees

Even with the flexibility provided by OWL’s Flexible Paid Time Off (PTO) policy, all full-time exempt employees are still expected to:

Work a nominal 40-hour work week, on average, over the course of a year.

Be generally available during standard business hours, defined as 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. local time, Monday through Friday - unless alternative arrangements have been discussed and approved.

Regularly attend internal meetings, client sessions, and other collaborative efforts without disruption to team or project continuity.

We recognize that life happens and support reasonable flexibility based on time zones, caregiving responsibilities, and personal needs. Exempt employees may adjust start/end times, take breaks during the day, or structure their schedules to maximize productivity—as long as they meet their role responsibilities, maintain clear communication, and ensure full client and team coverage as needed.

Full-Time & Part-Time, Non-Exempt Employees

Due to legal and operational considerations, full- and part-time non-exempt employees follow more standardized work schedules, subject to federal and state wage and hour laws.

Standard Schedule Expectation:

Full-time non-exempt employees work 40 hours per week, typically from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. This includes two 15-minute paid breaks and one unpaid 1-hour lunch break each day.

Part-time employees follow the schedule outlined in their employment agreement.

Example:

100% (Full Time): 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., M–F (40 hrs/week)

50% (Part Time): 8 a.m. – 12 p.m., M–Th + 4 flex hours

Flexible Alternatives:

Alternative schedules may be approved on a case-by-case basis by a Director or the OWL Leadership Team, based on individual circumstances and organizational needs. Such flexibility requires:

Documented approval outlining expected start/end times, total weekly hours, and any applicable core hour commitments.

Full compliance with meeting and service obligations, including time tracking and overtime rules.

Note that OWL reserves the right to adjust or revoke flexible schedules at any time based on operational requirements, client needs, or performance concerns.

Final Note on Availability

All employees—regardless of exempt or non-exempt status—are expected to:

Maintain open communication about their availability

Respond in a timely manner to messages and meeting invites during working hours

Notify their team or Director as early as possible about any schedule changes, absences, or time-sensitive needs.

Flexible work works best when it's paired with transparency and trust. We’re committed to helping everyone succeed in their roles while respecting personal boundaries, life commitments, and collective responsibility.

## COMPENSATORY TIME (“COMP TIME”)

OWL recognizes that the nature of our work sometimes requires employees to go above and beyond standard work hours—whether to meet a tight deadline, support a multi-day event, or travel over weekends for client engagements. To support sustainability and flexibility, OWL offers comp time—the ability to flex your schedule and take additional time off when significant extra hours have been worked.

For Full-Time, Exempt Employees

Exempt employees (covered under OWL’s Flexible PTO policy) are not eligible for overtime pay, but may take comp time when their workload includes:

Significant additional hours worked in a given week

Business-related travel or events on weekends or holidays

Extended days beyond typical expectations

Comp time for exempt employees is flexible and informal, but must be:

Communicated in advance or promptly after the extra time is worked

Coordinated with a Director and any team members affected by your absence

Recorded on Slack and your Google Calendar to ensure transparency and continuity

While there’s no strict hour-for-hour accrual system, we trust exempt employees to manage their workload responsibly and use comp time to stay balanced and well.

For Non-Exempt Employees

Non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a given workweek, as governed by federal and state wage laws. Because of this:

Comp time may not be used as a substitute for overtime pay (e.g., "banking hours" in one week to take time off in another week is not permitted in lieu of overtime).

However, non-exempt employees may flex hours within the same workweek, with prior Director approval, to balance early or late work with shorter days elsewhere in the week.

Example:

If a non-exempt employee works 10 hours on Monday, they may work fewer hours later in the same week—as long as the total remains at or under 40 hours.

If the week exceeds 40 hours, overtime pay will apply, and any additional time off must be scheduled separately as vacation or personal time.

Summary of Comp Time Guidelines

Note: Comp time should never create confusion around deliverables or collaboration. Keep your calendar up to date, communicate early and clearly with teammates, and reach out to your Director if you need support managing your time or schedule.

## OVERTIME PAY (ONLY APPLICABLE TO NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES)

In accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), only full- and part-time non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. Overtime is defined as any authorized time worked in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek.

Overtime Pay Rates:

Standard Overtime - Time worked beyond 40 hours in a single workweek is paid at 1.5x the employee’s regular hourly rate.

Holiday Overtime- Any hours worked on an OWL-recognized holiday are paid at 2x the employee’s regular hourly rate, regardless of the total hours worked that week.

Note: Holiday pay for working on a recognized holiday is separate from the standard holiday pay provided to eligible employees who do not work that day. Employees who are required to work on a recognized OWL holiday will receive double their regular hourly rate for all hours worked on that day, in addition to any standard holiday pay they are eligible for.

Authorization Requirements

Overtime must be approved in advance by the employee’s Director or the OWL Leadership Team.

In urgent or client-driven situations where advance approval isn’t possible, the employee must notify their Director as soon as possible for retroactive approval and documentation.

While unauthorized overtime may lead to corrective action, OWL will compensate all overtime hours worked, in compliance with federal labor laws.

Time Tracking & Payroll

Non-exempt employees are required to accurately record all time worked, including overtime, using OWL’s official time tracking system.

Overtime is paid in the regular payroll cycle following the week in which it was earned.

Paid holidays, PTO, sick leave, and other forms of paid time off do not count toward the 40-hour threshold for standard overtime calculation.

Note: For information related to compensatory time (comp time) and overtime eligibility, especially for non-exempt employees, please refer to the above COMP TIME section of this Handbook. These policies are grounded in FLSA guidelines and help ensure both fairness and compliance.
