# Professional Expectations and Conduct

## Purpose

This document outlines OWL’s expectations for professional appearance, hygiene, and virtual presence. As ambassadors for our mission, team members are expected to uphold standards that reinforce credibility and professionalism in all client-facing interactions.



## DRESS CODE & PERSONAL HYGIENE


Why Professional Dress Matters at OWL: In education settings—especially at the leadership level—there is often an expectation of formal or business professional attire. School administrators and district leaders often will dress in suits, ties, dress slacks, blouses, or business skirts, setting a standard for their schools and differentiating themselves from students. Many schools also require their teachers to maintain a professional dress code as a reflection of their role as leaders and role models.

Because OWL’s work primarily takes place in these education settings, where expectations for professionalism remain high, we must meet or exceed those same standards. Our appearance is often the first impression clients have of our expertise and the quality of our work. Dressing professionally reinforces our credibility, builds trust with educators and school leaders, and ensures that we are taken seriously as partners in transforming learning environments.

With this in mind, OWL expects all employees to maintain a polished, professional appearance when engaging in face-to-face interactions (such as school visits, workshops, and client meetings) as well as virtual meetings, where professional presence still plays a key role in building relationships.

Minimum Expectations for Face-to-Face Interactions: When engaging in in-person client-facing activities, OWL employees are expected to dress in business casual attire at a minimum. This means:

A well-maintained, polished appearance that conveys confidence and credibility.

Collared shirts, sweaters, blouses, dress pants, slacks, skirts, or professional dresses are appropriate.

Neat and professional footwear (e.g., dress shoes, loafers, or clean, professional boots; no flip-flops or overly casual sneakers).

Avoid overly casual, revealing, or distracting clothing, including distressed jeans, leggings (unless styled professionally), athletic wear, or overly bold patterns that may detract from a professional image.

In cases where the environment demands a higher level of formality, employees should adjust their attire accordingly (e.g., a blazer or sport coat for leadership, funder, or policy-maker meetings).

Expectations for Virtual Meetings: In virtual settings, first impressions are equally important. OWL employees should adhere to the following:

Dress as if attending an in-person meeting. Professional business casual attire is expected, including a collared shirt, sweater, blouse, or other appropriate professional top. Avoid casual wear such as T-shirts, hoodies, or sleepwear.

Ensure proper grooming and a neat appearance. Your face and upper body are visible on screen, and personal presentation should reflect professionalism.

Consider camera angles, lighting, and background. A well-lit, uncluttered background enhances professionalism and helps maintain focus on the discussion.

Hygiene and Personal Presentation: Regardless of whether the interaction is in person or virtual, employees are expected to maintain professional hygiene standards, including:

Regular bathing and good oral hygiene.

Using deodorant/antiperspirant to minimize body odors, especially in close-contact settings.

Avoiding heavily scented perfumes or colognes that could cause allergic reactions or discomfort for clients and colleagues.

Final Note: OWL values individuality and recognizes that personal expression is important. However, as representatives of OWL in education spaces, we must align with the professional expectations of our clients and partners. Employees whose attire or presentation is deemed inappropriate will be addressed on an individual basis. We trust our team to exercise good judgment in their appearance, ensuring they positively represent OWL in all professional interactions.
