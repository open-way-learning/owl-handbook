# Reimbursements And It

## REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES

OWL supports a distributed, flexible work environment and aims to ensure employees are not burdened with costs associated with fulfilling their roles. OWL reimburses reasonable and necessary expenses related to work travel, professional development, and technology when incurred in service of the organization’s mission.

General Reimbursement Guidelines

Reimbursement is authorized for reasonable and necessary business expenses, including but not limited to: mileage, parking fees, airfare, lodging, meals (per diem), and work-related supplies or services.

All reimbursements must be:

Pre-approved (if not explicitly covered by contract or policy);

Entered into Productive by the employee within 90 days of the expense;

Accompanied by receipts for all items over $25 (receipts under $25 are encouraged, especially for grant-funded work).

Refer to the  for full details on per diem, ground transportation, accommodations, flight guidelines, and booking expectations.

Use of Company Credit Card

Full-time employees may request an OWL-issued company credit card for approved work-related expenses.

If you have a company card, you must use it for all eligible travel and service-related expenses, unless a valid exception is pre-approved.

Do not use the company card for personal expenses under any circumstance.

Receipts and notes must be submitted in Productive for all company card purchases for audit and reconciliation purposes.

Travel for Professional Development or Conferences

OWL may fund employee travel and registration for conferences or professional events aligned with:

The employee’s professional development goals; and/or

OWL’s current or future service offerings.

Expenses related to conferences or professional events may be covered by OWL, subject to the following conditions:

Prior written approval must be obtained from the OWL Leadership Team;

Funds must be available within the annual professional development budget;

Employees must log time and expenses in Productive per standard practice.

Note: OWL distinguishes professional development from marketing/ presence-related events. Attendance at conferences primarily for brand awareness, recruitment, or sector engagement may be covered, but may not count toward individual PD budgets unless explicitly approved.

Technology Stipend for Full-Time Employees

To support OWL’s remote and flexible work environment, full-time employees receive a monthly technology stipend of $80 to offset the cost of mobile phone and home internet use for OWL-related work. The $80/month stipend is:

Automatically included in payroll;

Treated as taxable income;

Meant to cover phone, data, or broadband access used for communication, virtual facilitation, and digital collaboration;

No receipts are required, and employees may use the stipend at their discretion.

If desired, OWL may instead cover internet or mobile costs directly using the company card, but only if:

The account is in OWL’s name;

The service is used exclusively for OWL-related business;

Pre-approval is received from the Director of Operations & Finance.

Part-time employees are not eligible for the monthly technology stipend.

## INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

Open Way Learning (OWL) provides the essential hardware, software, and cloud-based tools necessary for employees to perform their roles effectively in a distributed, remote-first environment. This policy outlines expectations for equipment usage, data management, and eligibility for technology-related support.

Technology for Full-Time Employees

All full-time employees will be provided with the following standard equipment:

Laptop (Mac or PC, based on role and inventory)

External monitor

Keyboard and mouse

Necessary cables, adapters, and accessories

This equipment is the property of OWL and must be returned upon separation from the organization unless otherwise approved.

File Storage & Content Management

To ensure data security, knowledge continuity, and organizational alignment:

All OWL-related content (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, media, planning files, etc.) must be created and stored within the OWL Google Workspace environment (i.e. using your @openwaylearning.org account).

Employees may not store or manage OWL-related content in personal Gmail accounts or external cloud storage systems.

Files should be organized clearly and kept up to date in shared team folders or designated drive locations to ensure accessibility by others as needed.

Hardware Ownership, Return, & Purchase Option

All OWL-issued equipment is OWL’s property. Employees must return hardware in good condition upon exiting the organization.

Departing employees may request to purchase their issued device, pending approval on a case-by-case basis. Purchase price will reflect a prorated fair market value, and the request must be approved by the Director of Operations & Finance.

All stickers or customizations must be school-appropriate and removed prior to return (including residue cleanup).

Technology Stipend & Replacement Policy

To ensure long-term device reliability, OWL provides a $1,000 technology stipend to each full-time employee to procure a new laptop once every 36 months (3 years), starting from the date of hire or last issued device/stipend.

The purchased device becomes property of the employee and must meet OWL’s minimum technical specifications.

Employees who leave OWL within 12 months of receiving the stipend may be required to reimburse a prorated amount.

Employees may choose to continue using OWL-issued equipment instead of claiming the stipend, provided the hardware meets ongoing performance standards.

Requests to claim the stipend must be submitted to the Manager of Finance, HR, & Communications.

Device Use & Maintenance Responsibilities

Employees are expected to:

Use OWL-issued laptops exclusively for work-related purposes. Devices should not be shared with family or friends.

Restart laptops at least once per week to support system performance and updates.

Keep OWL files in the Google Drive environment, not stored locally unless temporarily necessary.

Keep hardware clean and in good condition using non-abrasive cleaners.

Promptly report any technical issues or damage to the Director of Operations & Finance.

Understand that any damage caused by misuse or negligence may result in personal financial responsibility for repair or replacement.

Exceptions to these policies must be approved in writing.

Software Access for Full-Time Employees

Full-time employees will receive access to the following tools and platforms:

Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.)

Productive (for task planning, time tracking, and project budgeting)

Slack (for team messaging and internal communications)

Zoom (video meetings, phone calls, and webinars)

Mural (for collaborative design sprints and visual facilitation)

Calendly or OnceHub (for scheduling external and internal meetings)

Additional software may be provisioned based on the employee’s role or project needs.

Technology Expectations for Part-Time Employees

Part-time employees are expected to use their personal devices and maintain the following minimum standards:

Operating System: macOS 10.15+ or Windows 10+

Web Browser: Chrome (preferred), Firefox, Safari, or Edge

Internet Speed: Minimum 5 Mbps upload/download

Webcam: Required for meetings and external service delivery

Due to the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) nature of part-time roles, OWL does not provide IT hardware support for personally owned devices. However, part-time employees will be granted access to OWL software tools based on their roles and responsibilities.

VALUE ADDED MEETINGS

Synchronous time at OWL is a very valuable commodity. One of the ways we work to honor that time is by ensuring any meeting time you have to do is run efficiently and adds distinct value to your work and the work of your colleagues. To that end, we ask all team members to adhere to the following expectations for any internal, ad hoc meetings:

Start and end the meeting on time.

Be present, or be elsewhere. In other words, if you are not going to be prepared and engaged, then don’t waste the time of your colleagues.

Avoid large meetings that involve 6 or more people, unless you're certain that every participant is providing value to the whole audience (follows the famous Amazon “two pizza”rule -  If a meeting can’t feed people with just two pizzas, it’s too big of a meeting).

Avoid frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.

Defer to short meetings (30 minutes) vs long meetings (1 hr or more) where possible.

Every meeting should have a published agenda, ideally the day before it starts so that participants can prepare for efficient sync time to discuss and resolve important subjects. The agenda must include the meeting’s goals and deliverables (preferably no more than three).

Synchronous OWLmeetings should be based on topics that require verbal, face-to-face interaction (including on Zoom). In other words, we only discuss Live Topics in any synchronous OWL meeting, leaving Async Topics for “read only” response and follow up after the meeting. As such, all OWL meetings will include a Google Doc for notes (ideally included in the meeting invitation) for capture and follow up of Async Items so that they do not detract from the core agenda, goals, and deliverables. Where appropriate, important Async Topics should land in the OWL kanban (Productive platform) so that they do not get lost.

Avoid “informational” meetings that address items that could easily be handled via asynchronous communication such as email or Slack.

To ensure that we are holding ourselves accountable to these expectations, every OWL employee is fully empowered to leave or drop off a meeting that does not follow the above criteria or as soon as it becomes obvious you aren't adding value. The rule of thumb is that it is not rude to leave, but it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.

Note that OWL obviously cannot impose these expectations on persons outside the organization that lead meetings for which we participate. Nevertheless, you should model the value of meeting efficiency by emphasizing, as applicable, these expectations when you are given the opportunity to lead an external meeting. You are also welcome to lead through influence by sharing these expectations with non-OWL colleagues, where it is appropriate to do so.

Other Meeting Norms: In addition to the above minimum expectations, OWL also encourages employees to adopt these norms/best practices in order to help OWL meetings be welcoming and safe spaces for open dialogue and problem solving:

Remove Distractions: We know that life happens, especially when working from home. And while we want to bring humanity to the process, we also want to help everyone remain focused on adding value in the time we are together. As such, work to remove distractions from your workspace during the time of the meeting.

Always be Open & Honest: State your views in a transparent manner and ask genuine questions if you do not thoroughly understand something. This enables the team to shift from monologues and arguments to a conversation in which members can understand everyone’s point of view and be curious about the differences in their views. This also means that we use a “Speak now, or forever hold your peace” approach to ensure that what needs to be discussed and resolved in a meeting (or in a formal follow up session) happens and does not devolve to “water cooler talk.”

Share all Relevant Information: This enables the team to develop a comprehensive, common set of information with which to solve problems and make decisions.

Grounding via Context: By using specific examples, the team can see and agree on what important words mean. This ensures that all team members are using the same words to mean the same thing.

Explain Reasoning & Intent: This enables members to understand how others reached their conclusions and see where team members’ reasoning differs.

Tackle Issues, Not People: By moving from arguing about solutions to identifying needs that must be met in order to solve a problem, you reduce unproductive conflict and increase your ability to develop solutions that the full team is committed to. Use a "don't make things personal, and don't take things personally" rule of thumb.

Test Assumptions & Inferences: This ensures that the team is making decisions with valid information rather than with members’ private stories about what other team members believe and what their motives are.

Notice & Reflect on Bias & Systems of Oppression: Similar to the above (and following the design process adopted by the ), take intentional pauses to reflect and notice how the work is proceeding so that it explicitly addresses issues of equity and inclusion and is not reinforcing systems of oppression.

Co-Design Next Steps: OWL is small and nimble enough where we can strive for consensus wherever possible, including input from all stakeholders/users. This ensures that everyone is committed to moving forward together as a team.

Acknowledge the Elephants in the Room: This ensures that the team addresses the important but undiscussed issues that are hindering its results and that can only be resolved in a team meeting.

Follow the 40 Second Rule: Be aware of how long you have been speaking and find a way to hand it off to someone else. This helps share the air and encourages others to engage with the conversation.

In addition to the above criteria for all ad hoc OWL meetings, we also hold routine standing meetings and check in meetings. Those meetings, including their standing agendas, are explained in more detail in

DRESS CODE & PERSONAL HYGIENE

Why Professional Dress Matters at OWL: In education settings—especially at the leadership level—there is often an expectation of formal or business professional attire. School administrators and district leaders often will dress in suits, ties, dress slacks, blouses, or business skirts, setting a standard for their schools and differentiating themselves from students. Many schools also require their teachers to maintain a professional dress code as a reflection of their role as leaders and role models.

Because OWL’s work primarily takes place in these education settings, where expectations for professionalism remain high, we must meet or exceed those same standards. Our appearance is often the first impression clients have of our expertise and the quality of our work. Dressing professionally reinforces our credibility, builds trust with educators and school leaders, and ensures that we are taken seriously as partners in transforming learning environments.

With this in mind, OWL expects all employees to maintain a polished, professional appearance when engaging in face-to-face interactions (such as school visits, workshops, and client meetings) as well as virtual meetings, where professional presence still plays a key role in building relationships.

Minimum Expectations for Face-to-Face Interactions: When engaging in in-person client-facing activities, OWL employees are expected to dress in business casual attire at a minimum. This means:

A well-maintained, polished appearance that conveys confidence and credibility.

Collared shirts, sweaters, blouses, dress pants, slacks, skirts, or professional dresses are appropriate.

Neat and professional footwear (e.g., dress shoes, loafers, or clean, professional boots; no flip-flops or overly casual sneakers).

Avoid overly casual, revealing, or distracting clothing, including distressed jeans, leggings (unless styled professionally), athletic wear, or overly bold patterns that may detract from a professional image.

In cases where the environment demands a higher level of formality, employees should adjust their attire accordingly (e.g., a blazer or sport coat for leadership, funder, or policy-maker meetings).

Expectations for Virtual Meetings: In virtual settings, first impressions are equally important. OWL employees should adhere to the following:

Dress as if attending an in-person meeting. Professional business casual attire is expected, including a collared shirt, sweater, blouse, or other appropriate professional top. Avoid casual wear such as T-shirts, hoodies, or sleepwear.

Ensure proper grooming and a neat appearance. Your face and upper body are visible on screen, and personal presentation should reflect professionalism.

Consider camera angles, lighting, and background. A well-lit, uncluttered background enhances professionalism and helps maintain focus on the discussion.

Hygiene and Personal Presentation: Regardless of whether the interaction is in person or virtual, employees are expected to maintain professional hygiene standards, including:

Regular bathing and good oral hygiene.

Using deodorant/antiperspirant to minimize body odors, especially in close-contact settings.

Avoiding heavily scented perfumes or colognes that could cause allergic reactions or discomfort for clients and colleagues.

Final Note: OWL values individuality and recognizes that personal expression is important. However, as representatives of OWL in education spaces, we must align with the professional expectations of our clients and partners. Employees whose attire or presentation is deemed inappropriate will be addressed on an individual basis. We trust our team to exercise good judgment in their appearance, ensuring they positively represent OWL in all professional interactions.

OPEN SOURCE LICENSING OF MATERIALS

OWL believes that knowledge grows stronger when it’s shared. That’s why, whenever possible, we release the materials we create, especially those developed for client use, under  licenses, aligning with our values of transparency, collaboration, and collective impact.

Most of OWL’s public-facing resources (e.g. slide decks, protocols, frameworks, tools, and guides) are made available for reuse and adaptation under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license or a similar open license, unless otherwise restricted by client contract or grant agreement.

What This Means for You

Before sharing OWL-created resources externally (outside of a client or internal team), check to ensure the materials:

Are covered under an OWL Creative Commons license (preferred is BY-NC-SA 4.0); or

Are not subject to client or funder confidentiality or usage restrictions.

If you plan to reference or adapt materials from another source, especially proprietary content, ensure that:

The material is openly licensed; or

You have documented permission to use or adapt it; or

You cite and link to the original source per fair use guidelines.

Honor Intellectual Property - Ours and Others’

We take intellectual property seriously, not as a way to control ideas, but to honor the labor and creativity of others. This means:

Always giving proper credit;

Never claiming others’ work as our own;

Asking questions when unsure.

If you’re ever uncertain about how or whether a resource can be shared, check in with a Director before making it public. We’d rather slow down to get it right than misstep in how we represent our work or that of others.

For more information on licensing protocols and usage rights, refer to the .

MEDIA CONTACTS

Any request for information or interviews by the media should be referred to the OWL Director of Outreach & Programming.

OWL TRAVEL POLICY

OWL employees are often required to travel on behalf of the organization in order to provide services to our clients. Refer to  for details on what is required when traveling for OWL business.

PROTECTION OF MINORS POLICY

Open Way Learning is committed to maintaining a safe and supportive environment for all individuals, including minors (under age 18), especially in the context of school-based partnerships, student exhibitions, or community-engaged learning. This policy outlines OWL’s procedures and expectations for protecting minors from abuse, neglect, or harm during OWL-affiliated activities.

Scope

This policy applies to all OWL staff, fellows, contractors, and volunteers who may, through their work, interact directly or indirectly with minors in either physical or virtual environments.

Code of Conduct for Interacting with Minors

All OWL-affiliated adults are expected to:

Maintain professional, respectful boundaries at all times.

Avoid being alone with a minor unless in a public, observable space (“observable and interruptible”).

Not share personal contact information or communicate with minors outside of professional channels.

Avoid transporting minors in personal vehicles or hosting them in personal residences.

Obtain written parental/guardian permission before photographing or recording minors.

Avoid behavior or language that could be perceived as abusive, sexual, or discriminatory.

Prohibited Behaviors

OWL strictly prohibits:

Physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or harassment of any minor.

Use of inappropriate, suggestive, or discriminatory language or jokes in the presence of minors.

Giving alcohol, drugs, or inappropriate materials to minors.

Photographing minors on personal devices for non-OWL purposes.

Retaliation against any individual who reports suspected misconduct or abuse in good faith.

Mandatory Reporting Requirements

All OWL-affiliated adults are mandated reporters. If you suspect that a minor is being abused, neglected, or is the victim of a violent or sexual offense, you must:

Immediately:

Contact 911 if the child is in immediate danger.

Report the concern to the Department of Social Services (DSS) in the county where the child resides or is physically located.

Notify an OWL director (e.g., Director of Outreach & Programs), who will document the report and ensure organizational compliance.

Note that you are not responsible for investigating - only reporting in good faith. Reasonable suspicion is enough. North Carolina law provides immunity for good-faith reporters (G.S. § 7B-309).

Background Check Requirements

To protect minors and ensure trust with partner organizations, OWL requires background checks for:

Employees, OWL Fellows, or contractors expected to have direct, non-incidental contact with minors.

Volunteers who may be present in unsupervised or extended contact roles.

Anyone assigned to OWL-led events involving youth interaction outside of immediate school staff supervision.

Process Overview:

Trigger Point: The Director of Outreach or Program Manager identifies individuals requiring a check based on their project role.

Consent: The individual completes a standard background check consent form (provided by OWL).

Vendor Screening: OWL uses , a nonprofit-friendly background check service with strong experience supporting small education nonprofits.

Review & Recordkeeping: A designated OWL director securely reviews results and logs only the clearance status (no sensitive data stored).

Renewal Schedule: Background checks are valid for three years for staff and one year for short-term contractors or volunteers.

Background checks include identity verification, sex offender registry screening, and criminal history review. Additional DMV checks may be conducted when travel with minors is involved.

Training & Certification

All OWL-affiliated individuals who may work with minors must:

Complete OWL’s annual Protection of Minors Training (30–45 minutes).

Sign an annual Acknowledgment Form affirming understanding of the policy and reporting obligations.

Training Includes:

Overview of this policy

Recognizing signs of abuse and neglect (emotional, physical, sexual, neglect)

Dos and Don’ts for adult-minor interactions

Bullying and peer-on-peer abuse awareness

Reporting steps and emergency response

Scenario-based reflection questions

Partnership & On-Site Alignment

OWL-affiliated personnel are also expected to adhere to any child safety policies of the partner schools or organizations where programming occurs. This may include sign-ins, escort policies, mandatory ID badges, or other supervision protocols.

OWL defers to these host site procedures while ensuring this internal policy remains the minimum baseline standard for all engagements involving minors.

Refer to Appendix A and Appendix B for more information.

POLICY FOR GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, DALL·E, etc.) have quickly become part of the modern knowledge economy, and the education landscape is no exception. At OWL, we recognize both the creative potential and the ethical considerations of using these tools in our work.

As an open, forward-thinking organization, OWL encourages thoughtful and transparent use of AI, especially when it can save time, spark ideas, or improve quality. At the same time, we are deeply committed to ensuring that the final outputs - whether public-facing or internal - reflect human-centered insight, cultural relevance, and the distinct voice of OWL.

Guidelines for Responsible AI Use

You are free to use generative AI tools to assist in the drafting, research, or design of materials for internal planning, professional learning, or organizational development. However, any final product, especially those shared with external audiences (e.g., clients, funders, partners), must:

Be meaningfully reviewed, edited, and customized;

Accurately reflect OWL’s values, voice, and cultural tone;

Be free from bias, inaccuracies, or copyright risks associated with unedited AI-generated content.

AI should augment your creativity, not replace your critical thinking or professional judgment.

Attribution & Transparency

If AI was used to substantially shape or generate any part of a public-facing or published work, please include a brief attribution (e.g. “This content was co-developed with support from generative AI tools and refined by OWL team members”).

If you're unsure whether attribution is warranted, seek input from a colleague or Director before finalizing the work. When in doubt, lean toward transparency.

What’s Not Allowed

Never submit unedited, AI-generated content as a final product.

Do not use generative AI to create outputs on sensitive topics or client materials without human review and adaptation.

Do not present AI-generated writing or images as original OWL work without meaningful transformation or attribution.

A Living Policy

This policy will evolve as the technology evolves. We are committed to responsible innovation and will continue to update our practices based on:

Emerging industry standards;

New research on ethical and equitable AI use;

Ongoing conversations with educators and communities.

PROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION AND DOCUMENT HANDLING

How we show up in shared digital spaces is part of how we live our values. As such, whether drafting a proposal, co-authoring slides, co-designing a scope of work with a client, or collaborating in a Mural board, our documents should reflect clarity, professionalism, and our deep commitment to openness and co-design.

Most materials we produce, especially those related to our work with schools, should be assumed to be public-facing or sharable unless clearly marked otherwise. This approach not only aligns with our open source principles, but ensures that everything we produce can hold up to public scrutiny.

That said, some documents are intended for internal use only, such as budget worksheets, internal retrospectives, HR records, or rough-draft planning documents. These should be clearly labeled and securely shared with only those who need access.

A good rule of thumb: Never write or share anything—anywhere—that you wouldn’t stand behind with the OWL logo and your name attached.

Client-Facing Documents & Draft Proposals

OWL takes pride in providing customized, co-designed proposals and scopes of work, but only after we’ve had a chance to listen deeply, define the scope, and iterate internally. To that end, we ask that all employees follow this general process:

Use early conversations with clients to listen, gather context, and build alignment, but always hold off on presenting any detailed budgets, rates, or timelines until OWL’s internal team has had a chance to:

Collaboratively review and vet the item internally per the client the request;

Estimate effort using our standard processes (e.g. this );

Clarify expectations and constraints;

Align the proposed work with OWL’s capacity and values.

Avoid sharing anything that could be mistaken for a final proposal (e.g. draft budgets, daily rates, or scope assumptions) without prior internal vetting by the  OWL Leadership Team.

If creating a working doc with external partners, label it clearly as a “Work in Progress” and limit its content to high-level discovery elements:

Key goals or desired outcomes;

Possible formats or delivery structures;

Partner assets and constraints;

Draft timeline or metrics (without final cost figures).

We absolutely believe in co-design, but we also believe in producing the highest quality work products and service. That means we keep early drafts simple and focused (less is more) and only share a formal proposal after we’ve completed internal vetting. A proposal should be the final product of our process, not the starting point.

Field Notes, Observations, and Internal Debriefs

OWL team members often take notes during school visits, workshops, or meetings to support reflection and continuous improvement. These may include internal observations, hunches, or candid assessments. While this practice is encouraged, it is essential to clearly distinguish private reflections from materials intended to be shared, including always writing internal notes with professionalism and care. Even if something is labeled “internal,” assume it could one day be seen by a partner, school team member, or funder.

Avoid speculation or personal commentary about individuals or school dynamics.

Document facts and insights, not assumptions or opinions.

When writing something potentially sensitive, ask yourself: Would this build or harm trust if shared accidentally?

If you’re unsure whether a note, doc, or comment thread should be shared or edited, check in with a Director first.

PRICE STRUCTURE FOR OUR SERVICE

OWL believes that learning communities should never be priced out of learner-centered transformation. Our pricing philosophy reflects not just an economic model, but a moral stance grounded in trust, transparency, and our mission.

Our goal is not to be known as “affordable” or “expensive,” but as worth it—because what we deliver is truly unique, deeply customized, and transformational. We bring high-quality, mission-aligned services to schools, districts, and communities at a price that reflects their context and needs, not just our bottom line.

We also believe in something we call market karma: when we show up with integrity, do exceptional work, and focus relentlessly on impact, good things follow. Satisfied partners become loyal advocates. Word spreads. Our reach grows. This is why our best marketing isn’t a slick ad campaign or fancy pitch - it’s the stories schools tell about the inherent value of working with OWL.

We also recognize that no two learning communities are the same. That’s why we do not use fixed, one-size-fits-all rates. Instead, each scope of work is co-designed and priced in collaboration with the client and reviewed by the OWL Leadership Team, with open input from any OWL team member involved.

Value Before Cost

Our services, not surprisingly, are anchored in an open-source mindset:

All core OWL resources (frameworks, tools, protocols) are openly licensed and freely available for use and adaptation.

What clients pay for is not the product, but the amplification of that product’s value through expert facilitation, strategic thinking, design expertise, targeted coaching, and deep culture work.

Doing so means we provide premium services that quicken the pace of progress and help schools truly embed and scale learner-centered innovations in locally sustainable ways. In short: the products are free - our value is in the transformation.

Pro Bono with Purpose

In some cases, we may offer our services at reduced rates or pro bono if we believe the opportunity:

Advances our mission in a high-impact way;

Builds our brand and trust in a new region;

Serves as a long-term investment in a community or network.

We do this strategically, not as charity, but as part of a broader effort to deepen access and equity across education.

Our Pricing Principles

Our approach to pricing reflects the same values that define how we partner, design, and lead:

Collaboration: We price through conversation, not dictate. It’s a partnership from the start.

Results-Oriented: Our pricing reflects the real, measurable outcomes we aim to help our clients achieve.

Efficiency: We keep our estimates and proposals transparent, flexible, and easy to understand.

Equity & Inclusion: We design our pricing so that schools and districts of any size or setting can access what we offer.

Iteration: We encourage long-term partnership, often scaling support as a school evolves (e.g. using the OWL Maturity Model).

Transparency: We clearly communicate what’s included, why it costs what it does, and where we can flex if needed.

How We Set Our Rates

OWL uses a value-based pricing model, not a strict hourly or per-diem system. That means:

We start with the school or partner’s goals, assets, and context.

We estimate the true value of the outcomes we’re co-creating.

Then we design a scope and price that’s fair, feasible, and mission-aligned—for both OWL and the partner.

There are moments when that number is higher than a school expected. There are also times when we go lower than what we “should” charge. That’s the trade-off of doing our mission-driven work the right way, despite what the market might say.

What we won’t do: Let cost be the reason a school misses out on the chance to create something better for students. We will find a way.

ONE LAST THING: BRINGING THE OWL CULTURE TO LIFE (EVERY DAY)

No matter your role, title, or location, you’re part of a team that’s committed to something more than just getting things done - we’re building a culture. One that models what schools themselves should feel like: curious, courageous, joyful, and generous.

So here’s our invitation to you: Let’s not just talk about our values, let’s live them. Let’s bring energy, care, and imagination to the work we do and to the people we do it with.

If you work for Open Way Learning in any capacity, here are some small ways you can help make our culture extraordinary:

Add positive energy to every conversation

Practice “Yes, and…” to build on each other’s ideas

Ask more questions than you give answers

Remove old tasks that no longer serve our mission

Treat clients better than they expect

Offer help before you’re asked

Leave things more organized than you found them

Invent a moment of silliness every day

Highlight good work from your peers

Be on the lookout for future OWLers

Be mindful of costs—but bold in value

Commit to learning and help others grow too

Spark new services that people truly want

Read, explore, and feed your curiosity

Celebrate tough decisions and the clarity they bring

Learn from what didn’t work—and talk about it

And yes… smile a lot

These aren’t rules. They’re reminders of what kind of place we want this to be, and what kind of teammates we want to be for each other.
