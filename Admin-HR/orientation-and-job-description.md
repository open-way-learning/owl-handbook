## NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION

An employee’s first 90 days of employment are critical to success in their role. During their first 90 days, employees will receive essential training and resources to support them in getting to know their role, their colleagues, and OWL and will check in with their manager at regular intervals to gauge areas for further learning and development.

OWL is committed to developing thoughtful onboarding plans and materials to ensure that employees are set up for success in executing on their responsibilities in service of OWL’s mission. To that end, every new part or full time employee will undergo an onboarding process to ensure they fully understand the expectations of their role and how it aligns with the overall mission of the organization, especially regarding any client-facing work.
