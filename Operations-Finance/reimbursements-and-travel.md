# Reimbursements, Travel, and Purchasing

## Purpose

This document outlines OWL’s policies for expense reimbursement, use of company credit cards, and travel guidelines related to conferences, professional learning, and service delivery. These systems help ensure fiscal responsibility, clarity, and equity across all travel and purchasing activities.



## REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES


OWL supports a distributed, flexible work environment and aims to ensure employees are not burdened with costs associated with fulfilling their roles. OWL reimburses reasonable and necessary expenses related to work travel, professional development, and technology when incurred in service of the organization’s mission.

General Reimbursement Guidelines

Reimbursement is authorized for reasonable and necessary business expenses, including but not limited to: mileage, parking fees, airfare, lodging, meals (per diem), and work-related supplies or services.

All reimbursements must be:

Pre-approved (if not explicitly covered by contract or policy);

Entered into Productive by the employee within 90 days of the expense;

Accompanied by receipts for all items over $25 (receipts under $25 are encouraged, especially for grant-funded work).

Refer to the for full details on per diem, ground transportation, accommodations, flight guidelines, and booking expectations.


## Use of Company Credit Card


Full-time employees may request an OWL-issued company credit card for approved work-related expenses.

If you have a company card, you must use it for all eligible travel and service-related expenses, unless a valid exception is pre-approved.

Do not use the company card for personal expenses under any circumstance.

Receipts and notes must be submitted in Productive for all company card purchases for audit and reconciliation purposes.


## Travel for Professional Development or Conferences


OWL may fund employee travel and registration for conferences or professional events aligned with:

The employee’s professional development goals; and/or

OWL’s current or future service offerings.

Expenses related to conferences or professional events may be covered by OWL, subject to the following conditions:

Prior written approval must be obtained from the OWL Leadership Team;

Funds must be available within the annual professional development budget;

Employees must log time and expenses in Productive per standard practice.

Note: OWL distinguishes professional development from marketing/ presence-related events. Attendance at conferences primarily for brand awareness, recruitment, or sector engagement may be covered, but may not count toward individual PD budgets unless explicitly approved.
