## Purpose (what this role exists to achieve)
Safeguard OWL’s solvency and operating excellence by steering budget strategy, compliance, contracting, HR policy, and org systems—so the team can deliver mission-aligned work confidently and sustainably.

## What success looks like (core outcomes)
- **Financial clarity:** Reliable dashboards, clean books, on-time invoicing, healthy cash position.
- **Risk under control:** Compliant contracts/insurance, clear travel/expense policy, fast mitigation.
- **Systems that scale:** Lightweight SOPs and tools (Drive, Slack, Productive, QB) that people actually use.
- **Frictionless delivery:** Finance/ops enable—not block—program quality and development momentum.

## Decision rights & guardrails (snapshot)
- **One “A” rule:** DFIO is **Accountable** for budget strategy, financial dashboards, compliance/HR policy, contract/admin terms, travel above budget, and risk posture. **Consulted** = D-OSL/DPD/DPIV as appropriate.
- **ROI Guardrail:** Commit only if **deposit in hand**, **>minimum margin**, **pass-throughs matched to receipts**, **or** there’s a **funded path ≤90 days**; exceptions are explicit strategic investments logged in #decision_log.
- **Logging:** Post Strategic/Tactical outcomes in **#decision_log** (3–5 lines: summary, RACI-S, why it matters, next step, link).

## Scope of work (high-signal summary)
- **Financial strategy & reporting:** Annual budget, forecasts, monthly dashboards, AR/AP oversight, grant burn tracking.
- **Contracting & compliance:** Templates, terms, insurance/COI, vendor management, audits/readiness; quick turn contract admin.
- **HR & policy:** Contractor/Fellow agreements, onboarding/offboarding standards, travel/expense and reimbursement policy.
- **Systems administration:** Drive/permissions, Slack/Google Workspace, Productive, QuickBooks; SOP maintenance with D-OSL.
- **Risk management:** Incident response, records retention, data/privacy posture (FERPA/PII), cybersecurity basics (2FA, access).

> *Note:* The former “Manager of Finance/HR/Comms” responsibilities are merged into DFIO. DFIO may designate helpers, but **DFIO remains Accountable**.

## Interfaces (who you co-design with)
- **D-OSL — Strategy & Learning:** Strategy ↔ budget/risk alignment; SOP adoption; board-visible items.
- **DPIV — Program Impact & Visibility:** Event budgets/logistics, brand/comms compliance, artifact/evidence pipelines.
- **PMs — Site Delivery:** Budget-to-actuals, receipts/time entry, scope or travel exceptions, contract amendments.

## KPIs & review cadence
- **Weekly:** Cash position signal; AR aging exceptions; compliance/insurance flags; tooling incidents (if any).
- **Monthly:** Finance dashboard (budget vs. actuals, forecast, days cash, AR/AP, grant burn); policy updates; open risks.
- **Quarterly:** Scenario plans, audit/readiness status, records retention and access reviews; policy diffs merged to SOP.

## Operating discipline (always)
Use Slack for essential comms; keep Productive and QuickBooks in sync; submit receipts/billables weekly; maintain file hygiene; enforce calendar accuracy and “sub plans” when OOO; status format: **Here’s where we are → Here’s the gap → Here’s the next step.**

## RACI-S snapshot (common calls)
- **Budget Strategy & Dashboards:** **A = DFIO**, C = D-OSL/DPD/DPIV, I = Board (as required).
- **Contract Terms & Compliance:** **A = DFIO**, R = DFIO (admin), C = DPD/PM (scope), D-OSL (precedent), I = Team.
- **Risk Escalation/Crisis:** **A = DFIO** (operational risk) or **A = D-OSL** (mission-critical), C = DPD/DPIV, I = Board as required.
- **Travel Above Budget / Exceptions:** **A = DFIO**, C = PM/D-OSL, I = Team.
