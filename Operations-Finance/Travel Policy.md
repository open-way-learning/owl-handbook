### **PURPOSE**

This policy ensures that all OWL-related business travel is conducted fairly and responsibly. While OWL employees must follow this policy, independent contractors (hereafter "consultants") are strongly encouraged to follow it for consistency and ease of reimbursement. This policy is not exhaustive; travelers are expected to use sound judgment and act in an ethical, practical, and fiscally responsible manner.

### **GENERAL ITEMS**

* **Reimbursable expenses** must be necessary for OWL business, reasonable, and compliant with IRS, state, or grant-specific regulations. This ensures OWL is fiscally responsible and maintains compliance with applicable laws and funding requirements.   
* **Pre-authorization** is required for all domestic travel via a Statement of Work (for employees) and a Scope of Work (for consultants). This helps OWL manage budgets and maintain accountability for all travel-related activities.  
* **Exempt Employees \-** These employees are paid a fixed monthly salary and are not compensated based on individual services or hours worked. Their travel-related work is included as part of their regular duties unless otherwise specified in their Statement of Work.  
* **Non-Exempt Employees and Consultants \-** These individuals are compensated on a fee-for-service basis, meaning they are paid for specific tasks, services, or travel time as outlined in their approved Statement of Work (for employees) or Contractor Scope of Work (for consultants). Travel-related time or expenses are only compensable if explicitly included in the contract.  
* **Booking expectations**:  
  * Arrange travel 30–45 days in advance to secure lower fares and provide sufficient lead time for planning.  
  * OWL’s Manager of Finance, HR, and Communications may book travel if specified to ensure alignment with organizational policies.  
  * Use credible travel providers to reduce risks and ensure reliability.  
  * Book lowest reasonable fares (not based on rewards/perks) to optimize cost efficiency.  
  * Any exceptions must be approved by an OWL Director in writing to ensure consistent application of policy.  
* **Policy violations** may result in disciplinary action or termination of contract to preserve the integrity of the organization.

### **REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES**

OWL supports a distributed, flexible work environment and aims to ensure employees are not burdened with costs associated with fulfilling their roles. OWL reimburses reasonable and necessary expenses related to work travel, professional development, and technology when incurred in service of the organization’s mission per the following guidelines:

* Reimbursement is authorized for reasonable and necessary business expenses. Examples of reimbursable items include, but are not limited to:  
* Airfare and related taxes/fees  
* Ground transportation (e.g. rental cars, mileage, gas, public transit, tolls, parking)  
* Per diem for meals and accommodations. *Note: Per diem rates vary by location. Reference your contract or the GSA website: www.gsa.gov/perdiem. You may shift spending between days, but your total per diem must not be exceeded. This flexible approach allows for occasional higher-cost meals or lodging if offset elsewhere in the trip.*

* All reimbursements must be:  
  * Pre-approved (if not explicitly covered by contract or policy);  
  * Administered through Productive.io (or invoice to OWL \- contractors only) within 90 days of the expense;  
  * Accompanied by receipts for all items over $25 (receipts under $25 are encouraged, especially for grant-funded work), including dates and contract reference for clarity and audit purposes.

The following items ase are non-reimbursable because they fall outside of business necessity or may violate funding source restrictions:

* Car rental insurance beyond required (see Ground Transportation)  
* Personal trip changes  
* Spending beyond per diem  
* Resort or hotel fees (unless pre-approved due to lack of alternatives)  
* Flight upgrades, alcohol beyond per diem, club dues  
* Alternate lodging if host/accommodations are arranged  
* Tips outside of per diem, fines, personal property losses, in-room entertainment, child/kennel care, personal guests’ costs

### **TRAVEL RELATED COMPENSATION:**

OWL strives to ensure fair compensation for travel and planning time, particularly for non-exempt (hourly) employees and consultants. However, we must also adhere to the specific terms and limitations of each client contract to maintain budget integrity and organizational sustainability.

#### **Default Compensation Structure (Unless Otherwise Stated in Contract)**

When a client requires an itemized breakdown of services, OWL applies the following standard rates by default:

* **Travel Time Compensation**  
  * Travel is compensated at ½ the normal hourly facilitation rate, up to one total day per round-trip service visit (split across departure and return days).  
  * Travel costs may also include:  
    * Reimbursement at the current federal mileage rate (for personal vehicle use)  
    * Meal and lodging per diem based on federal GSA rates  
  * Compensation caps apply:  
    * Flights \< 2,000 miles: 0.5 daily rate  
    * Flights ≥ 2,000 miles: 1.0 daily rate  
    * Ground \< 200 miles: 0.5 daily rate  
    * Ground ≥ 200 miles: 1.0 daily rate

* **Planning Time Compensation**  
  * Planning is compensated using a default ratio of 1 planning day per 3 service days (i.e., a 1:3 planning-to-service ratio), unless otherwise stated.  
    *Note: Some client contracts may explicitly exclude planning or travel compensation. In such cases, OWL can only reimburse or compensate for time that is allowed within the contract’s terms.*

* #### **Non-Compensable Time**

  * #### The following time is not eligible for compensation unless explicitly approved in the applicable Statement of Work or contract:

    * Time not listed in the contract or Scope of Work  
    * Meal breaks where no work is performed  
    * Overnight stays (e.g., sleep time)  
    * Social functions attended voluntarily  
    * Normal daily commuting time from home to local departure point (airport, etc.)

### **Air Travel**

* Travel should align with service dates. If reasonable, return the same day when possible to limit expenses.  
* Fly from your home airport unless pre-approved for alternative logistics.  
* Flights should fall within 20% of lowest fare, unless hardship is documented (e.g., red-eye or excessive layovers).  
* OWL will inform travelers when a client requires travel booking through their system to comply with client contracts.

### **Hotel**

* Book within federal per diem limits. OWL reimburses only up to those rates regardless of where you stay.  
* If travel is \< 50 miles from home, pre-approval is required to ensure the necessity of overnight lodging.  
* Delays/cancellations: OWL reimburses reasonable extra hotel costs with documentation.  
* Staying with friends/family is allowed and per diem applies (no extra reimbursement). This provides flexibility and potential cost savings.

### **Ground Transportation & Rental Cars**

* Only get a rental car if it is cheaper or more practical than alternative ground transportation options (e.g., rideshare or public transit).  
* Economy rentals are preferred; upgrades only if necessary or free.  
* Gas must be refilled before return—no prepay gas due to high markups.  
* Only use OWL’s preferred rental car providers (contact the Manager of Finance, HR, & Communications if you have questions).  
* Carpool when feasible to reduce costs and environmental impact.  
* Employees paying for a rental car using a company [AMEX card](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/features-benefits/policies/car-rental-loss-and-damage-insurance-terms.html) receive limited loss and damage coverage for the rental in question. If you use another card and cannot verify that this coverage is included as part of the rental, PLEASE MAX OUT ALL INSURANCE OFFERED BY CAR RENTAL AGENCIES WHEN RENTING CARS FOR WORK TRAVEL. Options for insurance should be researched prior to renting a car and unnecessary optional coverage avoided. It is the responsibility of the employee to verify appropriate insurance coverage requirements and limitations prior to the rental.    
* OWL will reimburse employees and consultants for rental vehicles up to a base rate of $55 per day (before taxes and fees). This cap is based on a combination of factors, including:  
* Typical market rates for economy-class rentals from national providers such as Enterprise and Avis, which average between $40 and $60/day depending on location and season.  
* Federal travel guidelines that, while not setting a specific daily rental rate, support use of competitively priced vehicles under negotiated government contracts.  
* OWL’s own vendor agreements with Avis and Enterprise, which often allow access to rates within this threshold.  
* The need for budget consistency, cost control, and equitable standards across all travel-related projects.

  If the lowest available economy-class rate in a given location exceeds $55/day, the traveler must obtain written pre-approval from an OWL Director prior to booking (or another OWL Director if applicable). In such cases, the traveler should provide documentation (e.g., screenshots from travel platforms) demonstrating that no reasonable alternatives are available within the stated limit.

**Personal Vehicles:**

* Mileage reimbursed at IRS rate with mileage log.  
* Drivers must carry: $100k liability / $25k property minimum for protection in case of incidents.  
* Contractors must have a commercial auto policy.

**Indemnity Clause for Consultants:** Consultants must indemnify and hold OWL harmless for any claims, losses, or damages related to any travel arrangements they make or participate in. This protects OWL from liability tied to third-party contractor travel arrangements.

### **Per Diem & Tips**

* Per diem applies for travel and service days as noted in contract.  
* Tips are included within the per diem; do not claim extra.  
* Receipts are not required for per diem but recommended for audit purposes. Retain receipts when federal or grant funds are used.  
  *Please note that per diem amounts will vary depending on location and it is your responsibility to know what amount has been specified in each contract so that you can keep total meal and accommodation expenses within those amounts. Also note that the total per diem amount is what is tracked, and not individual expenses. For example, employees may “bank” their spending on one day and then apply that later in a trip (e.g. ordering the dollar menu at McDonalds so that you can enjoy a much nicer meal on another day).* 

### **Internet Access**

* Hotel data charges are reimbursable.  
* Airport, café, or in-flight data charges are not due to variability and potential personal use.

### **International Travel**

* Must have valid documents, immunizations, and follow local customs requirements.  
* OWL reimburses the same categories as domestic.  
* No reimbursement for exchange or international phone/data fees due to personal variability.  
* OWL provides repatriation services for employees (not contractors).  
* Travel to countries under the State Dept. Level 3/4 or CDC Level 3 alerts must be pre-approved to manage risk.

### **Service Cancellations**

* Refer any cancellation from a client directly to an OWL Director for coordination and documentation (or another OWL Director if applicable).  
* Cancellations before departure: no per diem or travel time.  
* After arrival: OWL reimburses travel day per diem and related costs.  
* Non-refundable flight credits must be used on the next OWL trip to avoid waste.

### **Travel Safety Requirements & Best Practices**

* Never use cell phones while driving unless hands-free. Pull over to take calls.  
* Share your itinerary with a colleague for accountability.  
* Review destination safety and plan for emergencies in advance.  
* For international travel, register with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive updates and assistance.

### **Company Vehicle Use (OWL Employees Only)**

* Only authorized employees may operate company vehicles.  
* Operators must have a valid driver's license and clean driving record.  
* Non-employees and non-business passengers are not allowed for insurance reasons.  
* Personal use of the company car is not allowed.  
* Follow all traffic laws, vehicle maintenance, and safety rules. Monitor tires, gas, and fluids regularly.

  *Violations of company vehicle policy may lead to disciplinary action.*

### **ACCIDENTS RELATED TO COMPANY TRAVEL**

Whether driving a company vehicle, a rental car, or your personal vehicle while conducting OWL-related business, the following procedures must be followed in the event of an accident, theft, or malicious damage:

#### **1\. Ensure Immediate Safety**

* Prioritize the safety of all individuals involved.  
* Call emergency services if there are injuries or hazardous conditions.  
* If the vehicle is operable and it’s safe to do so, move it to a secure location out of traffic.

#### **2\. Notify Local Authorities**

* Contact law enforcement to report the incident and request an official accident report, especially when injuries occur or damage is significant.  
* Cooperate with responding officers, but **do not admit fault** or speculate about liability.

#### **3\. Exchange Information**

* Share only legally required information (name, contact, vehicle registration, insurance details) with other involved parties.  
* Avoid discussing responsibility or making statements that could be interpreted as accepting blame.

#### **4\. Document the Scene**

* Take photos of the vehicle(s), surrounding area, road conditions, any injuries, and license plates.  
* Collect names and contact information of witnesses when possible.  
* Write a brief account of the incident while details are still fresh.

#### **5\. Notify OWL Leadership**

* Contact your manager or an OWL Director (or another OWL Director if applicable) as soon as possible, and **no later than 24 hours** after the incident.  
* Provide all documentation, including photos, police report (if applicable), and a written summary.

#### **6\. Cooperate with Claims Process**

* OWL will coordinate with the relevant insurance provider (company policy, AMEX coverage, or one of OWL’s partner carriers) depending on the vehicle involved.  
* Employees must follow all applicable insurance reporting guidelines and timelines.  
* Do **not** authorize repairs, guarantee payment, or accept liability without explicit approval from an OWL Director.

### **COMPANY CREDIT CARD USE**

* Full-time employees may request an OWL-issued company credit card for approved work-related expenses.  
* If you have a company card, you must use it for all eligible travel and service-related expenses, unless a valid exception is pre-approved.  
* Do not use the company card for personal expenses under any circumstance.  
* Receipts and notes must be submitted in Productive for all company card purchases for audit and reconciliation purposes.

### **TRAVEL FOR PD OR CONFERENCES**

OWL may fund employee travel and registration for conferences or professional events aligned with:

* The employee’s professional development goals; and/or  
* OWL’s current or future service offerings.

Expenses related to conferences or professional events may be covered by OWL, subject to the following conditions:

* Prior written approval must be obtained from the OWL Leadership Team;  
* Funds must be available within the annual professional development budget;  
* Employees must log time and expenses in Productive per standard practice.

Note: OWL distinguishes professional development from marketing/ presence-related events. Attendance at conferences primarily for brand awareness, recruitment, or sector engagement may be covered, but may not count toward individual PD budgets unless explicitly approved.

### **TRAVEL FAQs** 

* How do I book air and hotel travel? *You are free to use any reputable travel platform or app as long as you look for the accepted and reasonably lowest cost options for the travel that’s needed for the service you are to provide. For airfare, this should be the lowest cost option, without having to fly a “redeye” to and from your home airport, unless the airfare is more than 20% of the lowest other option. For accommodations, you are free to select any you wish, knowing that the reimbursement amount will only cover the local per diem rates.*  
* What are the limits for travel? *Refer to the policy above. Email your manager or an OWL Director if you need to extend travel beyond these limits. Also be sure to make a copy of the approval email to any invoice or reimbursement request.*   
* Do I need to keep my receipts? *Yes. You should make every effort to keep every receipt, but receipts are only required for all expenses over $25. If you lose a receipt you should note that in the description field for that expense line item on your reimbursement request. Also note that itemized receipts are considered a best practice, especially for large expenses or for any work that involves external grants or federal funding. In these cases, an explanation of the business purpose should be provided on the receipt, as well as a list of who else was in attendance for meals.*  
* What expenses does the company pay for? *Airfare, car rental, ground transportation like Uber and Lyft, mileage reimbursement, and daily meal and accommodation per diem.*   
* How do meals work? *Unless stated otherwise, all OWL contracts include a per diem allowance. You are free to spend whatever you wish on meals, knowing that reimbursement will be limited only to the contracted per diem. Note that you are not reimbursed in cases where the client provides some or all meals (reimbursement requests must be prorated to reflect what was provided).*  
* How do I get reimbursed for travel expenses, and is the process different if I have a company credit card? *There are two different processes depending on if you are using a company credit card or your own form of payment (company AMEX cards are provided to some OWL employees). You are not reimbursed for company card expenses, as these are reconciled each month and paid automatically (employees are expected to keep all receipts for auditing and reconciliation purposes). All other travel expenses paid by your personal credit card or cash are eligible for reimbursement per the above policy, either by submitting an invoice (contractors) or by using the OWL Reimbursement Form (see above for details).*  
* Can I use a company credit card for some expenses but not all? *If you have a company credit card, you are expected to use it for all travel expenses, unless there is a valid reason not to use it. You may not use a company credit card for personal use.*  
* Can I take advantage of vendor or credit card rewards programs that I accumulate while on company travel? *In general, yes. Employees with a company credit card are free to use the points or airline mileage they accumulate for personal use. The same is true for other rewards programs such as hotel points or rental car rewards. However, the employee must not allow the point accumulation to be the driving motivation for selecting flights, hotels, rental cars, etc. That decision should be strictly based on the lowest reasonable cost to the nonprofit. Likewise, the company AMEX cards generally come with an annual fee that must be offset through rewards or miles earmarked for company travel (e.g. if I have a $300 annual fee for my card, I need to ensure that I use an equivalent amount of miles or points from that card for business travel). Apart from that offset, all remaining mileage and points are free for me to use for personal travel.*  
* Where do I log the amount of time I spent for a service? *All full and part time OWL employees are expected to track all time spent preparing, facilitating, and doing post-service follow-up via the Productive platform (note that some temporary employees may not have access to this platform and will keep a separate [time log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vj9ju-TZZC_zXfiFVuziwU7feTnk3H0rzWPtDzZsoq4/edit?usp=sharing) that is submitted to their manager on at least a monthly basis). Consultants should keep an itemized time log that will be used as the basis for compensation after the service is completed and per the rates agreed to in the Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work for that service.*  
* Do I need to differentiate between service prep, service delivery, and post service deliverables? *This depends on the rate schedule mentioned in the applicable Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work. In many cases, there is a flat rate in the service contract, although in some cases, rates are different for planning, travel days, and on-line service delivery. Always verify these rates in the contract terms before submitting time sheets or reimbursement requests.*   
* Do I get reimbursed for my travel time to and from a service? *This also depends on the service contract with the client and will be specified in the applicable Statement of Work and/or Contractor Scope of Work. When travel is included, it is often at a reduced daily or hourly rate (e.g. ½ the normal hourly rate). Always verify these rates in the contract terms before submitting time sheets or reimbursement requests.*    
* What is the expected total number of planning hours for each facilitation hour? I*n general, an OWL employee is expected to spend 0.5 days of planning per 1 day of service. This may vary, however, depending on prior service experience, the type of service being provided, etc. Please verify this amount with the respective OWL project manager if it is not explicitly stated in the applicable Statement of Work.*
