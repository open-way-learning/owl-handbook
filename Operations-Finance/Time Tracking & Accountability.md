#### **Purpose**

OWL is committed to transparent, accurate, and auditable timekeeping practices. Accurate time tracking ensures we comply with federal labor laws, maintain financial integrity, and meet the reporting requirements of contracts, grants, and restricted donations. It also enables OWL to make informed decisions about resource allocation and client engagement, without compromising the flexibility and trust that define our organizational culture.

All employees‚Äîexempt and non-exempt‚Äîare responsible for accurately recording time worked when:

* Performing services that will be billed to a client;  
* Working on projects funded by a grant, government award, or restricted donation;  
* Participating in an internal strategic initiative for which time data has been requested to inform future planning or funder reporting.

*Note: Time tracking is not about micromanagement. It‚Äôs about ensuring OWL remains a trustworthy steward of resources and a responsive, sustainable organization.*

#### **Timekeeping Platform & Frequency**

Time must be tracked using Productive, OWL‚Äôs official timekeeping platform (or an approved alternative). Employees must:

* Allocate time to specific clients, contracts, or projects when applicable;  
* Record time after-the-fact, based on actual activity (not budgeted estimates);  
* Finalize and certify records by the 15th of the following month.

For ease of access, a full set of ‚ÄúStandard Operating Procedure‚Äù videos for Productive is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DOifmB0RI4qV1wqcdtIsyVvm_BKxhvyP?usp=drive_link).

#### **Exempt Employee Requirements**

Exempt employees (full-time salaried staff not eligible for overtime pay) are not required to track all hours worked. However, they must track time in the following cases:

* Billable Client Work: To support accurate invoicing, time must be tracked for client-facing engagements where billing or reporting is required.  
* Work Funded by Restricted Sources: For grants, donations, or awards with reporting obligations, OWL must demonstrate appropriate use of funds via time records.  
* Strategic Internal Projects: For selected internal initiatives (e.g., pilots, funded prototypes), OWL leadership may request short-term time tracking for planning and learning purposes. These will be clearly communicated in advance.

Time unrelated to the above may be logged under ‚ÄúOWL Operations‚Äù or similar designations, and exempt staff are not expected to track their full 40-hour schedule unless otherwise specified.

#### **Non-Exempt Employee Requirements**

Non-exempt employees (hourly employees eligible for overtime) must:

* Accurately record start and end times for each workday;  
* Track meal periods, rest breaks, and any time away for personal reasons;  
* Ensure that total time aligns with assigned schedules and legal requirements.

All overtime (time worked over 40 hours per week) must be pre-approved by a Director or the OWL Leadership Team and recorded for payroll processing per the above OWL Overtime Policy.

#### **Rest Breaks**

* One 15-minute paid break for every 4 hours (or major fraction) worked.  
* Breaks should be taken near the midpoint of a shift.  
* Rest breaks cannot be ‚Äúbanked‚Äù to shorten the day or extend lunch periods.

| Hours Worked | Rest Breaks Provided |
| ----- | ----- |
| 3.5‚Äì6 hours | 1 break |
| \>6‚Äì10 hours | 2 breaks |
| \>10‚Äì14 hours | 3 breaks |

#### **Meal Periods**

* Unpaid 30-minute meal periods are required for any shift longer than 5 hours.  
* A second 30-minute meal period is required if working more than 10 hours, unless waived in writing (only if the first was taken).  
* Meal breaks must begin no later than the end of the fifth hour of work.  
* Employees must be fully relieved of duty during meal periods. Working ‚Äúoff the clock‚Äù is not permitted.

#### **Lactation Breaks**

OWL provides reasonable paid break time and a private space to express milk for nursing employees. Additional accommodations may be arranged by contacting a Director or the Director of Operations & Finance.

#### **Time Submission, Review & Certification**

* All time records must be certified by the employee and submitted to the employee‚Äôs Director or the Director of Operations & Finance no later than the 15th of the following month.  
* OWL‚Äôs Manager of Finance, HR, & Communication will review submissions prior to payroll processing.  
* In the case of timekeeping errors, employees must promptly notify the Manager of Finance, HR, & Communication or the Director of Operations & Finance.

#### **Time Tracking: Do‚Äôs & Don‚Äôts**

Time tracking at OWL is about shared accountability, not surveillance. Here‚Äôs what responsible, compliant timekeeping looks like in practice:

#### **‚úÖ Do:**

* Track time accurately and honestly, based on actual hours worked‚Äînot estimates or budget projections.  
* Use Productive (or the approved system) to log time consistently and by the 15th of the following month.  
* Categorize time correctly, especially if it‚Äôs related to a billable client, grant, or restricted fund.  
* Record start/end times and breaks accurately if you‚Äôre a non-exempt employee.  
* Update your time as you go, or at least weekly‚Äîwaiting until the end of the month can lead to errors.  
* Communicate early with your Director if you‚Äôre unsure how to log time or need to make a correction.  
* Report any concerns about pressure to skip breaks, work off the clock, or misreport time.

  #### **üö´ Don‚Äôt:**

* Round time to match a target budget or guess without checking your calendar or records.  
* Log time you didn‚Äôt work or fail to record overtime when it applies.  
* Delay time entry so long that accuracy can‚Äôt be reasonably verified.  
* Submit another employee‚Äôs time record (even as a favor).  
* Bank break time to leave early or combine it with lunch periods.  
* Work ‚Äúoff the clock‚Äù \- especially during meal breaks or after hours without approval and documentation.
